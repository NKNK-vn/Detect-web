        In large mixer bowl, combine 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt; 
     mix well. In saucepan, heat water, milk and shortening until warm

     grease top. Cover; allow to rise in warm place until light and 
     doubled, about 1 hour. 
        Punch down dough. Divide into 12 parts. On lightly floured surface
     roll or pat each half to a 14 x 7 inch rectangle.  Starting with
     shorter side, roll up tightly, pressing dough into roll with each
     turn. Pinch edges and ends to seal. Place in greased 9 x 5 or
     8 x 4 inch bread pans. Cover; allow to rise in warm place until 
     double, about 30 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes
