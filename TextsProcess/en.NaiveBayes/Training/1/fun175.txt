SIR, ARE YOU USING ONLY HALF YOUR BRAIN?
  

   You're pretty smart.  We all know that.

   You  know all about partial differential  equations,  computer 
programming,  cost analysis, flow charts and vectors.  If it  can 
be put into an equation, expressed in human language, or recorded 
on a graph, you can handle it.

   When it comes to the semantic circuit of the brain and precise 
manipulations  of symbol systems, you're a champ.  Any  everybody 
knows it.

   But   what  about  those  mysterious  right-hemisphere   brain 
functions?  Intuition?  Synergetic apprehension of whole systems?  
Esthetics and ESP?

   Imagine  trying  to  live with one eye, or one  lung,  or  one 
testicle.
   Isn't it equally a handicap to use only half your brain?
