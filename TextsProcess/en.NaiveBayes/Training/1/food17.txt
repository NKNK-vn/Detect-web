awful sandy!). Tear apart into small salad sized pieces.  In
a small bowl for each guest or in a large one (your choice)

Comments:
My mom used to make this and once you have it once you
develop a craving for it.  This salad is very tasty and
impressive to dinner guests and does NOT taste like cooked
spinach at all!
