Two recent incidents  have uncovered a previously unknown phenomenon of
the most serious gravity.

1.  At Duquesne Electric a worker  threw  an  electrical  switch into a
    closed position, which produced a short-lived electrical spark.

2.  An employee at UPS flipped open the colored lense  of  his  welding
    helmet to better position the welding rod.  He inadvertently struck
    the metal rod to be welded producing an electric arc.

BOTH MEN WERE  WEARING  CONTACT LENSES.  Upon returning home from work,
they removed the contact lenses, and  THE CORNEA OF THE EYE WAS REMOVED
ALONG WITH THE LENS.  RESULT: PERMANENT BLINDNESS!!!

The electric arc generates microwaves that instantly bond the cornea of
the eye to the lens, by drying up the fluid between  the  eye  and  the
lens.  THIS TRAUMA  (INJURY) IS PAINLESS AND THE INDIVIDUAL NEVER KNOWS
THAT AN INJURY HAS OCCURRED UNTIL THE CONTACT LENS IS REMOVED!!

As this phenomenon was UNKNOWN, no Federal,  State, or local safety and
health agency has regulations on this matter but they  are pursuing the
investigation and hopefully will take immediate action.

In the meantime,  it  is  suggested  that  NO CONTACT LENSES BE WORN by
anyone who is potentially subject to an electrical sparking situation.
