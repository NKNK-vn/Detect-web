: I am interested in learning more about the game
: I saw this reviewed in games magazine 12/94.

The game is played on a roughly triangular board that looks something
like the following:

Players take turns placing stones of their colour (one player is white,
the other black) on the board, trying to connect the 3 sides of the board
with a single set of fully connected stones.  The stones are placed on 
the intersection points on the lines.  A corner counts as being part of both
sides.

And don't forget the variant invented by Dan Hoey & myself, "Projective Y":-
played on the same board, but with diametrically opposite edge points
identified, (i.e. a board on a projective plane), the winner being the
first to make a closed loop which is non-contractible-to-a-point.

This is one of the more abstract of abstract games around; it should appeal to
mathematicians in particular.    J.H.Conway should have invented it!

: Why was the board shaped like that, rather than a straight hexagonal
: lattice?

There are 3 points which have only 5 connection points (rather than the
normal 6).  That forces the curved shape.  It also reduces the 1st player
advantage a little (in theory).  I still opt for 1 move equalization (e.g.,
player A moves.  Player B has option of accepting player A's move as his
own, or making his own move.  Play continues.)
