HEY, MAN, ARE YOU USING ONLY HALF YOUR BRAIN?


You're pretty hip.  We all know that.

   You can throw an I CHING hexagram and intuit its meaning.  You 
know all about Hedonic Engineering and staying high.  You've seen 
through all the social games.

   When  it comes to the neurosomatic circuit of the  brain,  and 
body wisdom, you're a champ.  And everybody knows it.


   But   what  about  those  mysterious   left-hemisphere   brain 
functions?   Would'nt you like to learn the secrets of the  West, 
previously  known  only to the adepts at the  esoteric  Princeton 
Institute for Advanced Studies?  Stranges arts like the Equation, 
which predicts things before they happen, or the Syllogism, which 
allows  you  to  test  an argument  for  internal  validity?   Or 
would'nt  you  like to know how the mysterious Stereo  works,  or 
what keeps planes from falling out of the sky?

   Imagine  trying  to  live with one eye, or one  lung,  or  one 
testicle.

   Is'nt it equally a handicap to use only half your brain?
