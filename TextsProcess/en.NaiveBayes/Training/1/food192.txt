 AFRICAN BEAN SOUP

      AFRICAN-SOUP - A Lenten soup with beans and peanuts

      This is a soup that we eat  during  Lent.  It  came  from  a
      Catholic leaflet that unfortunately I no longer have.

 INGREDIENTS (Serves 8)
      3 Tbsp    margarine
      2 cups    carrots thinly sliced
      12 cups   boiling water
      1 cup     black eye peas dry
      1 cup     navy beans dry
      1 cup     green pepper diced
      3 1/2 tsp salt
      1/8 tsp   crushed red pepper
      1 cup     salted peanuts chopped

      2 Tbsp    onion powder
      1 Tbsp    basil leaves crushed
      1 1/2 tsp ground coriander

 PROCEDURE
           (1)  Melt margarine in large stock pot.   Add  carrots.
                Cook for 5 minutes.

           (2)  Add water, black  eyed  peas,  navy  beans,  green
                pepper,  salt,  and  crushed  red pepper (add more
                water, if necessary, to cover).

           (3)  Cook, covered, until  ingredients  are  tender,  1
                1/2-2 hours.

           (4)  Add peanuts, onion powder,  basil,  and  coriander
                during last 10-15 minutes of cooking.

           (5)  Taste  to  correct  seasonings.   Soup  should  be
                thick.

 NOTES
      If you want more of a peanut flavor, add peanut butter  (any
      kind) to taste during step 4.  I use about 1/2 of a cup.

 RATING
      Difficulty: easy.  Time: 15  minutes  preparation,  2  hours
      cooking.  Precision: no need to measure.

 ALU PIAJER CHORCHORI ( dry curried potato and onion )


 Ingredients ( to serve 4-6 )
 5 medium sized potatoes, cut in half lengthwise and the sliced into 1/8" pcs.
 crosswise.
 4 onions cut in half lengthwise and then sliced thicker than normal.
 2 tsp. turmeric paste.
 1/2 tsp. chili paste.
 4-6 green chilies washed and slit.
 Salt to taste.
 2 tbsp. oil.
 1/2 cup water or as required.

 Heat oil. When a blue haze appears, add potatoes and fry for several minutes
 until potatoes turn opaque. Reduce heat, add onions and continue to fry,
 stirring now and then for a couple of minutes more.

 Add the turmeric, chili paste and salt to taste, mixing thoroughly and keep
 frying. Add green chilies.

 The potatoes and onions should cook as much as possible in their own juices,
 but if the curry gets too dry, test to see how much cooking the potatoes need
 and accordingly add water a little at a time.

 The cooked dish is dry and therefore adding of water should be judicious. The
 curry is done when the potatoes are cooked and there is practically no gravy.

 This curry can be reheated before serving, and is a good accompaniment with
 rice, luchis, or porota.

 I have excellent suggestions for tomato sauce, if anyone is interested.


 This method was created by me after several burning episodes:


 Ingredients:
 ============

 fresh Italian parsley- no stems if possible: about a handful
 fresh basil: about 2 handfuls
 fresh ground pepper: to taste
 extra vigin olive oil: enough to cover the bottom of the pan
 sugar (OPTIONAL): about 3 tablespoons
 onions: 1 or two small ones
 tomato puree: at least two large cans (judgement call)
 tomato paste: one small can in case you screw up
 salt (OPTIONAL): a little
 corn syrup: only idiots like R*gu do that!!
 garlic: 3 or 4 cloves, sliced very thin, so they melt away

 Slice onions and garlic (slice garlic any way you like, but thin is
 good).  Pour oil in bottom of pan.  Put heat on medium.  Brown onions-
 when almost done add garlic, and brown both of them.  add about 32 oz
 water, herbs, salt, pepper, sugar. It should be an ugly, watery
 greenish mixture. Let it cook for about two hours over medium heat and
 stir once in a while.

 Cooking the watery mixture ensures that the parsley gets thoroughly
 cooked, otherwise it tastes "grassy".

 Add puree and stir well. Cook for about an hour. If it is too watery,
 you can add the paste to thicken it.

 You can do variations on the above: add browned lamb, sausages, chopped
 STEAK (no burgers!!), chunky tomatoes, or this other stuf called
 "Caponata", which is an eggplant and celery and olive ensemble.

 Enjoy!!

 Here's a recipe for apple butter, as found in "Joy of Cooking"

    For best results use Jonathan, Winesap, Wealthy or other well-flavored
 cooking varieties.

 Wash, remove the stems, and quarter:
     4 lb. apples
 Cook slowly until soft in:
     2cups water, cider or cider vinegar
 Put fruit through a fine strainer.  Add to each cup of pulp:

     1/2 cup white or brown sugar
 Add:
     1 teaspoon cinnamon
    1/2 teaspoon cloves
    1/4 teaspoon allspice
        (Grated lemon rind and juice is optional)
  Cook the fruit butter over low heat, stirring constantly until the sugar
 is dissolved.  Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mixture
 sheets from a spoon.  You can also place a small quantity on a plate.  When
 no rim of liquid separates around the edge of the butter, it is done.  Pour
 into hot sterilized jars.

 Ingredients:

 8-10 apples
 1 cup sugar
 ground cinnamon
 1 stick butter (8 oz.), softened
 1 cup brown sugar
 pinch of salt
 1 cup flour

 Directions:

 Peel, core, and slice the apples and spread them in a rectangular cake pan.
 They should come almost to the top.  Pour sugar over apples.  Sprinkle
 cinnamon over apples to taste.  In a mixing bowl, mix butter, brown sugar,
 salt, flour.  It should have a mealy consistency, like dry oatmeal lumps.

 Spread the mix over the apples.  Bake at 350 F for 1/2 hour or until the
 apples are tender.  Serve warm or cold, plain or with vanilla ice cream.

 Don't plan on having any leftovers, but it reheats well.

 Assuming you know how to make a piecrust, real apple pie is very simple:

 1. Press the piecrust dough into a pie pan.

 2. Peel, core and cut baking apples (Jonathans?) into wedges/

 3. Toss with cinnamon, allspice and perhaps 2T-1/4c sugar and a bit of
 tapioca, cornstarch or flour for thickening;

 4. Fill the crust generously.

 5. Cover with piecrust and make zillions of holes with a fork
                      *or*
    Cut strips of pastry dough and *weave* a lattice top, as my mom does,

 APPLESAUCE CAKE

 1/2 cup oil
 1.5 cups sugar
 1.5 cups unsweetened applesauce
 2 cups flour
 1/2 tsp salt

 1.5 tsp baking soda
 1 tsp cinnamon    OR   1/4 tsp ginger     OR     1/2 tsp allspice
                      + 1/8 tsp cloves          + 1/8 tsp nutmeg

 Mix oil and sugar well, add applesauce, and mix in the dry
 ingredients.  Beat until smooth.  Pour into an oiled and floured pan
 and bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, slightly longer in a loaf
 pan.  This cake is even better the next day.

 Well, that's the recipe as it appears in The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook
 (more or less).  It's a typical Farm Cookbook cake recipe--no eggs, no
 dairy, but plenty of sugar.  Remarks:

 1.  The book specifies "white flour," but I had great
     results with whole wheat pastry.

 2.  The book says "8-inch cake pan or angel food cake pan," but an 8-inch
     pan is MUCH too small. As I recall, my 9-inch square pan nearly overflowed.

 3.  I don't remember which spice option I used.  I think I mixed cinnamon
     with one of the other two choices.

 4.  Nuts and raisins are good additions. Especially nuts sprinkled on top. YUM.

 Subject: VEGAN: Atole con Honholi

 This isn't a recipe. It is an interpretation of a demo a friend of mine
 did for me. Atole is gruel. This comes out about like thin malt-o-meal.
 You drink it.

 Incidentally, I would say that America has a love affair with vanilla.

 There is vanilla flavoring in just about everything remotely sweet. Now
 Mexico uses cinnamon alot. Even in the chocolate. And in Atole con
 Honholi (spelling uncertain my friend doesn't write stuff down).

 .5 C sesame seeds (honholi), toast in a pan til just turning golden
      grind in a blender until mealy, not floury
 4 C water or milk
 .5 C piloncillo (or dark brown sugar) or to taste. This is pretty sweet.
 .25 masa harina (more or less, depending on how thick you want it)
 1 tsp cinnamon

 Bring seame seeds, water(or milk) brown sugar and cinnamon to a boil.
 Sprinkle in masa harina (corn flour to you guys north of here)(thats
 *flour* not meal) and stir constantly. Add more flour if you want it

 thicker. Simmer for 5 minutes or so. Drink warm.

 The last time I made this I toasted the masa harina lightly. Gave it a
 little bit 'nuttier' flavor I think. And I prefer milk to water.

 Bagels:

 4 1/4 to 4 3/4 c. all-purpose flour
 1 pkg. active dry yeast
 1 1/2 c. warm water (120 to 130 deg F)
 1/4 c. sugar

 Combine 2 c. of the flour and the yeast.  Add warm water, 3 Tblsp.  of
 the sugar, and 1 tsp. salt.  Beat w/electric mixer on low speed 30
 seconds, scraping bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 min.
 Using a spoon, stir in as much remaining flour as you can.  Turn out
 onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough remaining flour to
 make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6-8 min.
 total).  Cover, let rest 10 min.  Working quickly, divide dough into 12
 portions.  Shape each portion into a smooth ball.  Punch a hole in the
 center of each ball with a floured finger.  Pull dough gently to make
 about a 2 inch hole, keeping bagel uniformly shaped.  Place on a

 greased baking sheet.  Cover, let rise 20 min.  (Start timing after 1st
 bagel is shaped.) Broil raised bagels about 5 inches from heat, 3-4
 min. turning once (tops should not brown).  Meanwhile, in a 12 inch
 skillet or 4 1/2 qt. dutch oven bring 6 c. water and remaining 1
 Tblsp.  sugar to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer bagels, 4 or 5 at a
 time, for 7 min., turning once.  Drain on paper towels.  Place drained
 bagels on well greased baking sheet.  Bake at 375 deg F for 25-30 min.
 or till tops are golden brown.  Makes 12 bagels.

 Light Rye Bagels:  Prepare as above, except stir 1 tsp. caraway seed,
 if desired, in with the yeast.  Substitute 1 1/2 c. rye flour for 1 1/2
 c. of the stirred-in all purpose flour.

 Herb Bagels:  Prepare as above, except stir 1 1/2 tsp. dried basil,
 crushed; 1 1/2 tsp. dried dillweed; or 1 to 1 1/2 tsp.  garlic powder
 in with the yeast.

 Onion Bagels:  Prepare as above, except stir 2 Tblsp. dried minced
 onion and, if desired, 2 Tblsp. cooked bacon pieces into the flour with
 the yeast.

 Whole Wheat Bagels:  Prepare as above, except substitute 1 1/2 c. whole

 wheat flour for 1 1/2 c. of the stirred-in all purpose flour.  Stir 3/4

 In the Joy of Cooking you can find the following:

     Basic pasta

 2-1/2C white flour  2/3C water  1t olive oil

 In a bowl, mix dry ingredients and make a well.  Beat liquids and pour
 into well.  Mix dry ingredients until dough forms and as much of the
 flour as possible is mixed in.  Turn out on a floured board or table.
 Flour your hands and knead dough until smooth and elastic, dusting your
 hands as needed.

 Roll into a ball, warp with plastic wrap (or cover with a wet towel)
 and allow dough to rest 10 minutes.  Cut into four pieces and shape
 into desired pasta.  If dough gets sticky, lightly dust with flour.

 Green noodles:

 puree' approximately 1/4C fresh or frozen spinach with the oil and
 water in a blender.  Mix it with the eggs and beat together -obviously,
 if you're not using eggs, this just goes in as part of the amount of
 water you're using-.  Add as usual.

 Various other colorants may be used, instead of spinach:

 tomato paste
 puree'd tomatoes
 puree'd beets (drained, or substitute their liquid for water)
 puree'd cooked carrots

 Put it into a mixer with bread hooks or a food processor, and knead until

 We've also substituted 1/4 of the flour with kamut, buckwheat etc. to
 add extra flavor, and the recipe suggested that chopped spinach, herbs,

 BATI CHORCHORI ( dry mixed vegetables )

 Ingredients ( serves 4-6 )
 200gms cauliflower florets.

 100gms shelled green peas.
 2 potatoes, peeled and cubed.
 1 medium eggplant, cubed.
 1 horseradish, peeled and cubed.
 1/4 onion, minced.
 1 tsp. turmeric paste.
 1/2 tsp. chili paste.
 2 tsp. mustard paste.
 3-4 green chilies, slit.
 4-6 tbsp. mustard oil.
 Salt to taste.

 This curry gets its name from the brass vessel ( bati ) in which it is
 cooked, so that the ingredients fit snugly in the bowl leaving just a
 one inch gap at the top. As a substitute, an aluminum or brass bowl
 with a tight fitting lid may be used.

 After cutting up all the  veggies, wash them well and place them in the
 bowl.  Add the mined onion, the masala pastes, and the green chillies.
 Add the oil and mix well after adding salt. Cover the bowl with its lid.

 Stir the vegetables occasionally over a medium-low heat, so they cook
 in their own juices withot any addition of water. remove from heat when
 the veggies are quite cooked and blended flavourfully with the spices.

 Any combination of vegetables may be used in preparing Bati Chorchori.

 This chorchori is a good accompaniment with rice.

 Sure! Lots! When I grill, I like to grill my entire dinner on over the
 coals, everything from appetizers to dessert. Here are some of the

 things I've done:

 1. skewered vegetables. Let marinate in Italian dressing or equivalent
    over night to pick up flavor. Cherry Tomatoes, chunks of green
    peppers, sweet onions, mushrooms, cubes of tofu (they really pick up
    the flavor), etc.  Soak the wooden skewers overnight before using to
    slow down the rate at which they blacken.

 2. Just skewered mushrooms. I separate these out because they are so
    incredibly delicious grilled that I often make them alone. Be sure
    to marinate them in some kind of oil-based marinade, or they dry out
    and shrivel up. (Try a mixture of olive oil, fresh organo, and
    garlic.) Brush on more of this oil as they're cooking. Be careful
    not to overdo it because the oil causes flare ups.

 3. Eggplant. This is also marvelous. Don't bother to salt/drain it, or it
    tends to get too dry on the grill. I like to use the Japanese
    eggplant sliced quite thin on the diagonal, grill until they start
    to blacken, and then toss the slices in a dressing made of olive
    oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic, dash of sugar,
    and dash of cayenne/red pepper flakes.

 4. Corn on the cob. Take off all the silk you can, then soak it in water
    in the husk. Put on the grill....yum.

 5. Baked potatoes. Since I hate to waste heat, I often wrap up a few

    potatoes in foil (wash first, and pierce skins) and set them over
    the coals as they're burning out. I don't know how long they really
    take, as I leave them overnight and they're done in the morning :-).
    The coals give a very interesting flavor to the potato.

    Something I've thought of to do at the next BBQ: wash and halve
    small red potatoes, then wrap them in foil with butter and onions
    and garlic. They should take a lot less time, and I'd imagine the
    flavors will blend well.

 6. Tofu and fish and onions. This is a favorite of a friend...marinate
    them all in soy sauce and onions and olive oil, then wrap in foil
    with the onions and toss on the grill. This was fantastic.

 Hi everyone!

 This is a vegan version of a recipe I lifted from "The Joy of Cooking".
 It sounds a tad yukky, but it is actually quite good. Also, the
 measurements are approximate, so one can adjust to their taste.

 Ingredients:

 1 can of beans (white northern or pinto are very good)
 1 onion (size depends on how much you like onions)
 1-2 cloves of garlic (I love garlic so I tend to use a lot.)

 1 medium sized apple
 1 orange
 2-3 tablespoons of honey

 2-4 tablespoons of maple syrup
 crushed nuts (almonds or cashews are good)
 cinnamon
 nutmeg
 rosemary
 white pepper

 Instructions:

 Put the beans in a small casserole dish or small bread-baking pan. Chop
 up the onions and spread them over the beans in the pan or dish. Do the
 same thing with the garlic, apple, and orange. Then, drizzle the honey
 then the syrup over the mixture. Mix the crushed nuts with the spices
 (use enough spices to suit your taste), and then drizzle the nut mixture
 over the beans and fruit. Bake at 300 degrees for 1-3 hours. Then put
 some on your plate and gobble it up!

    1 tsp. cayenne pepper
    1 tsp. salt
    5 cups crushed tomatoes
    4 to 6 (or more!) fresh jalapenos, seeded and deveined, finely chopped

 Sort and rinse the beans, place them in a pot with ``enough'' water and

 to cover by two inches and bring to a boil.  Simmer, covered, until
 beans are tender (about 1 hour), adding more water if necessary.  Drain

 beans, saving 3 cups of the liquid.  Return beans to pot with 1-1/2
 cups of the liquid.

 Roast the red bell pepper under the broiler until the skin is charred,

 then throw it into a paper bag and close the bag. Set it aside to cool.

 Heat oven to 325 degrees, put cumin seed and oregano in a small baking
 pan or casserole and roast until fragrant, shaking pan occasionally

 Heat oil in skillet.  Saute onions, green pepper and garlic for 3
 minutes, then add cumin, oregano, paprika, cayenne and salt.  Cook about
 10 minutes more, then add tomatoes and jalapenos and bring to a boil for
 a couple of minutes.  Stir all this in with the beans.

 Get the red bell pepper out of the bag, peel the skin off, remove seeds
 etc.  (After peeling, if any parts look like they got badly burned, cut
 them away.) Chop and add to beans.

 Simmer everything for a while, thinning with the rest of the saved bean
 liquid as desired.

 BLACK BEAN CHILI

 Ingredients :

 8oz(225g) black beans   900ml water
 700ml vegetarian soup stock  500ml tomato sauce (or chopped toms)
 2 tbsps olive oil   2 chopped onions
 5-8 cloves garlic (chopped)  1/2 sweet red pepper (diced)
 1/2 mild chilli    1 tbsp cumin
 2 tbsps mild chili powder  1 tbsp oregano
 1-2 tbsps salsa or hot pepper seasoning
 1oz (25g) chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)

 Method :

 1) Sort through the beans to remove any pebbles etc. Place in a large
 pot and add the water.  Soak overnight, or boil for 2 mins, remove
 from the heat, cover and let stand for an hour.

 2) Drain, then pour over fresh water to cover and bring to the boil.
 Reduce the heat and simmer for 1.5 hours, or until just tender. Add
 the stock and tomato sauce, then raise the heat and cook over a
 medium-high heat until the liquid reduces and thickens somewhat and
 the beans begin to fall apart into an ebony stew

 3) Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and saute the onion,
 garlic and red pepper, mild chilli, spices and oregano until the onion
 is limp. Add to the beans with the salsa and continue to simmer for

 another 30-45 mins. If the mixture is too soupy at the end of cooking
 then raise the heat to high and boil off some of the liquid. Take care
 to stir the bottom every so often so that it does not burn.

 4) Serve hot, garnished with corainder/cilantro

  Combine drained soaked beans and everything but the olives in a
 pot.  Bring to a boil and hold there about 10-30 minutes, cover.
 Simmer about 2 hours.  Stir in the olives.  (Or stir in olives about 15
 minutes before serving.)

  This should not be soupy, nor should it be too gloppy.  Watch
 it carefully in the last 45 minutes of cooking (30 minutes before you
 add the olives).

 Serve with rice or corn and whatever you want.  Serve hot.  Serves
 about 4.


 This dish goes well in tortillas with salsa, cheese, veggies; much as
 you would fill a taco.  Serve rolled and filled tortillas on a bed of
 lettuce or cooked cabbage (below), topped with melted cheese, salsa,
 chopped tomatoes and anything else you want to add.

 Experiment.  Enjoy!

 Throw in the cabbage, stirfry to coat well.  Stirfry about 2 minutes.

 Basically I do all my jam recipes the same, making variations as I want
 to experiment.

 Crush your berries to the desired texture.  If you want more of the
 fruit integrity, don't crush them very much.  Sprinkle very lightly
 with some sugar so that they will start forming a juice.  Measure 5
 cups of fruit and juice in a non-aluminum heavy pot.  Add 5 cups of


 sugar and mix well.  On a medium to high heat (don't use a real high
 heat as this will scorch the fruit and leave an awful taste in the jam)
 bring the mixture to a good heavy boil.  Remove any scum that forms.

 Add one package dry pectin and stir in well.  Keeping the mixture in a
 good boil, cook until the jam has reached the jelling point.  (I'm at
 work and can't look up the exact temperature--but to test for jelling
 stir down the mixture with a thin spoon such as a metal serving spoon,
 remove and holding the spoon at almost a straight angle down, let the
 jam slide off the spoon.  If the last two or three drops come together
 to form a sheet and sheet off the spoon the jam has reached the jelling
 point.)  Have your sterilized bottles ready along with the lids and
 rings simmering in hot water.

 Pour the jam into the jars, wipe the rims and seal.  The current USDA
 recommendations are to process the jam in a hot water bath for 10
 minutes for pints and to use the two part lids to seal and to not use
 pectin to seal the jars.  If you would rather not use refined sugar in
 your jam, the best bet is to contact your local county extension
 homemaker agent and ask for recipes using honey. I have never tried any
 using honey as I don't want the taste of the honey in the jam, but I
 have been told by friends that you can make very good jams using
 honey.  Sorry I can't tell you how long to boil the mixture as I live
 in the clouds and we have to boil everything longer than those of you

 who live closer to sea level.  Hope this helps.

 This past weekend I also picked more blackberries than a human can
 eat.  I made up this concoction as a sauce for duck (or other poultry),
 and it came out great:

 Put a pint of blackberries in a saucepan, moisten with about 1/3 to 1/2
 Cup of dry red wine.  Add a mashed clove of garlic, a couple of sprigs
 of fresh rosemary, some sugar (6-10 teaspoons, depending on how sour or
 sweet the berries are), and salt to taste.  Bring to a boil, cover, and
 simmer 10 minutes, occasionally stirring and mashing berries against
 side of pan with a spoon.

 Important note:

 This experiment achieved very good marks from my guests, except for one
 problem:  I didn't bother to remove the seeds, and a couple of people
 (myself included) grew tired of the hard seeds interrupting our
 enjoyment of the flavor.  You will probably want to strain the sauce
 somehow when it's done.  Maybe someone who has experience with berries

 and/or food mills and the like could e-mail me a note about how to best
 deal with blackberry seeds!

   I agree.  When looking for a good source of soluble fiber a couple
 of years ago, I decided that they provided the best, low-cost source.
 I have used two recipes of the last couple of years, the first I threw
 together from what was around, and the second I modifed from a Boston
 Baked Beans recipe (when I got tired of always eating the first).  I
 use a Crok Pot, but a bean pot in the oven at about 300F for 8 hours
 should work as well.

 This is a second Indian recipe.  It is an unfailing favorite everywhere
 we make it.  It is a deep-fried appetizer, great with cocktails, and
 for best effect, should be served with a fresh chutney, such as
 coriander leaves ground with fresh ginger, chopped green chilli pepper,
 some yogurt and maybe some mint leaves.

 Cut into matchsticks:
  1 large potato
  1 small eggplant
  1 onion


 There should be about equal amounts of each.

 Mix together about 1/4 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of chick pea
 flour (called *bessan* and quite a unique thing, which has the aroma

 and aftertaste of sprouted mung beans) and 1/2 tsp salt, some coarsely
 ground black pepper, 1 tsp ground coriander seed, 1 tsp ground cumin,
 and about 1 Tbsp of whole coriander seeds.

 Mix the flours and seeds into the vegetables, sprinkle on a couple of
 Tbsps of water--VERY LITTLE water--and mix together with your hands
 until it just holds together.  It's gooey.

 Fry tablespoons of this mixture in about 3/4 inch of very hot vegetable
 oil until golden brown--about 5 minutes.  Drain and serve hot.

 This comes from a lavish cookbook produced by the New York restaurant
 called The Bombay Palace, and which has sister restaurants in Europe.
 The food at the restaurant is wonderful, but the cookbook, for the most
 part (edited by the food critic Stendal) is a bust.  The recipes do not
 make up well, usually, with some exceptions.  This is one.

 (THAMBAYA THI THANAT)


 Make in the summer.  They marinate/pickle in a sunny window for 1+ months.

 From: The Burmese Kitchen by Copeland Marks and Aung Thein

 4 green limes quartered
 2 tsp salt

 2 tbl oil
 1" ginger cut into 4 slices  (candied ginger works nicely)
 1 tbl. white or cider vinegar
 2 tbl. sugar
 1 tbl. paprika
 1 tsp. garam masala
   (spice mixture that can include cinnamon, cloves, cumin, pepper, etc.  See
    Indian cookbook)
 1 tsp. cumin seeds
 2 cloves garlic, sliced

 1) Squeeze 1/2 the juice from each lime.  Mix the lime pieces with 1 tsp. of
 salt and put them in a jar with a tight lid.  Leave in a sunny window for
 4 days.  (I recommend adding something between the jar and it's lid because
 the salt tries to rust the lid.  A piece of plastic or fabric would probably
 work.)  Rotate the jar occassionally (daily) to keep everything mixed up.
 Save the extra lime juice for another purpose.

 2) Add the remaining 1 tsp. salt and mix and let the limes pickle in the
 sunny window for 1-2 months.  turn the jar around to mix everything up every
 couple of days.

 3) Heat the oil, add ginger and stir fry until the ginger is lightly browned.
 Add vingar, limes and the juice from the lime jar.  Mix and cook until the
 vinegar evaporated (2-4 minutes or so).  Add the paprika, garam masala, cumin
 and garlic.  Stir Fry from about 3 more minutes.

 4) Place in a clean jar and cover with a tight lid.  Can store on the shelf
 or will keep indefinitely in the refridgerator.


 5) Serve with a Burmese or Indian meal.

 I can recommend *New Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant*, on which this
 recipe is based. It's not entirely vegetarian, but quite a few of the

 recipes are vegetarian. It might be an ideal book for someone who's
 trying to cut down on meat. (I am vegan and find it worthwhile.)

 Don't be alarmed by the long list of ingredients! This is pretty easy if you
 get everything measured and/or chopped before you start cooking.

 This recipe is based on the "Mixed Vegetable Curry" from *New Recipes from
 Moosewood Restaurant*, by the Moosewood Collective. The mixed vegetable curry
 is also wonderful, and somewhat less starchy. The spice mix I list here, in
 fact, is identical to the Moosewood recipe.

 I came up with this variation because I wanted to duplicate a favorite dish
 of mine, Alo Chana Massala, which I used to eat at a little Indian restaurant
 on the other coast. With rice, it's a meal in itself, as far as I'm concerned.
 (It has to be, because I learned to cook in a coop of 35 people and I can't
 seem to master cooking for one.)

 But, I digress. "Feeds 4-6" is probably valid if you're using this as a main
 dish. Maybe even more. It's also quite spicy, if you follow my directions
 exactly. (It's spicier if you ignore my directions the way I do!)

 Chickpea and Potato Curry
 =========================

 Ingredients:
  vegetable oil,  4 tablespoons (or "as needed")
  black mustard seeds, 1/2 teaspoon

 (when I make this, I mix up 3 or 4 recipes-worth of the following dry spices
 at a time, so I don't have to measure them out every time I make a curry!)

  cinnamon,  1 teaspoon
  cardamom, ground, 1/2 teaspoon

  cumin, ground,  1 1/2 teaspoon
  coriander, ground, 1 1/2 teaspoon
  fennel seeds, ground, 1/2 teaspoon
  turmeric,   1/2 teaspoon
  cayenne,  1/2 teaspoon
  salt,   1 teaspoon

  garlic, minced,  3 cloves
  ginger root, grated 2 teaspoons

  onion, chopped,  1 large

  chickpeas (garbanzos) 1 cup dry
  potatoes, cubed, 3 cups
  tomatoes, chopped, 2 medium


  water,    1 cup

 Possible Garnishes:
  bananas, shredded coconut, toasted cashews, raisins,
  chutney, etc.

 Serve with: basmati rice (or other appropriate grain)

 Soak the chickpeas overnight (or as you normally do).  Chickpeas from a can
 are fine too, and quicker.

 Heat the oil in a skillet (I start with a couple of tablespoons, then
 add a little more if it gets too dry along the way). Add the mustard
 seeds and heat them until they start to pop.* Add the rest of the
 spices and cook on low for a couple of minutes. Add the onions and
 saute until translucent.**

 Add the potatoes and chickpeas, stir them, and cook a few more minutes. Add
 the water, cover the pan, and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring
 occasionally.

 The potatoes should be tender but not completely cooked now.  Add the tomatoes,
 stir, and cover for another 10 or 15 minutes.

 Serve with rice and garnish as desired.

 ======
 Notes:

 *   A word to the wise: cover the skillet during this step; those mustard
     seeds can fly! "New Recipes" considers the mustard seeds optional; they
     seem to provide much of the hotness of this recipe.


 **  This is misleading because you've just coated the onions with a

 I have couple of recipes with chickpeas and blackeyes peas. Both of
 which can be eaten with steamed rice or flat breads like pita bread or
 chapattis.

 BLACKEYED PEAS
   1/2 medium onion chopped finly
   1 clove garlic minced

   1/4 inch piece ginger minced
   chopped green chilies (to taste)
   1 can blackeyed peas
   1/2 tespoon cumin seeds
   1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
   1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
   1/4 teaspoon garam masala.
   Salt to taste
   Chopped Cilantro for garnish (optional)
   Fresh ground black pepper

   (1) Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet. Add cumin seeds

   (2) After a few seconds add onion, garlic, ginger and green chilies.
   (3) Cook the mixture till it's golden brown
   (4) Add the can of blackeyed peas, all the spices and salt.
   (5) Bring it to a simmer and let it cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes.
   (6) Add cilantro and black pepper before serving
      (Served over a bed of rice)

 SPICY CHICKPEAS
    1 medium onion minced
    2-3 cloves garlic minced
    1/4 inch piece ginger minced
    2-3 green chillies chopped finely (optional)
    2 medium tomatoes pureed
    1 can chickpeas
    1/2 teaspoon garam masala
    1 teaspoon cumin powder
    1 teaspoon coriander powder
    1/4 teaspoon tamrind paste (available in Indian grocery stores)
    1/2 teaspoon chillie powder (optional)
    Salt to taste
    Thinly sliced green onions for garnish (optional)

    (1) Heat 2-3 tablespoon oil
    (2) Add onion, ginger, garlic and green chillie. Cook till they are
        golden brown.
    (3) Add cumin, coriander and chillie powder.
    (4) Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes on medium heat
    (5) Add tamrind paste stir till it dissolves.
    (6) Add chickpeas and 1 can of water.
    (7) Cook covered on low heat till the liquid reduces to half.
    (8) Add the salt and garam masala, cook for a few more minutes
    (9) Garnish with green onions before serving.

 Note: Tastes best if the dish is prepared in advance and the chickpeas
 are allowed to absorb all the spices. May need to add a little water if

 the dish gets too thick. Just add a little water and bring the dish to
 a boil.  Dish is similar to the chickpea dish found in most Indian
 Resturants in US.

 Subject: VEGAN: Chinese Pickled Garlic & Lime and Garlic Olives

 I noticed a recent(ish) request for a method of making pickled garlic.

 Here's mine, based on a Sunday colour-supplement recipe of a couple of
 years ago. Rice vinegar is obtainable from oriental stores; don't use
 malt or pickling vinegar, it'll obliterate any other flavour.


 Chinese Pickled Garlic
 - ----------------------

         * 6 heads of young garlic
         * 600ml (1 pint) rice vinegar
         * 1 teaspoon salt

         * 1 tablespoon castor sugar
         * A few dried red chilis
         * 2 teaspoons green peppercorns

 Break up the heads of garlic, and top-and-tail the cloves, but don't
 bother to peel them. Place them in a bowl, and blanch with boiling
 water; leave for a few minutes, then drain.

 Meanwhile, dissolve the salt and sugar in the vinegar. Pack a pint jar
 with the garlic, add peppercorns and chilis, and pour over the vinegar.
 Leave to cool, then seal tightly.

 Notes:
   - Leave for 6 months before trying !!
   - The skin will peel very easily.
   - Don't use unprotected metal lids on your jars (unless you *like*
     aqueous solutions of metal salts..... :-)


 While on the subject of pickles, here's a recipe (from the same source)
 for olives....

 Lime and Garlic Olives
 - ----------------------

         * 225g (8oz) black olives
         * Juice, zest and peel of 3 limes
         * 1 head of garlic

         * 1 tablespoon whole coriander
         * Olive oil

 Drain the olives, and place them into a half-pound pickling jar.
 Roughly grind the coriander and heat in in a few tablespoons of oil for
 a minute. Take the zest of two limes and the peel from the third, and
 add to the oil with the juice of all three limes. Thinly slice the
 garlic, add it to the oil, saute briefly, and pour over the olives.
 Fill with more oil to cover, then seal and leave for a month before
 eating.

 Subject: VEGAN: Chinese Steamed Buns

 For those of you out there that would like to make stuffed, steamed
 buns in a matter of minutes, you can use biscuit dough -- the stuff
 that comes already made into biscuits in round tubes found in the
 refrigerated foods section near the butter, eggs, & cheese.  Pop open
 the tube, take a biscuit, gently flatten it somewhat especially around
 the edges, glob a bit of filling into the center, close the biscuit up
 around the filling, and twist to seal.  Steam in your bamboo steamer
 for 10-20 minutes (depending on the type of filling -- i.e., cooked vs.
 raw meat, veggie, sesame, etc.).

 For the REAL thing, however, here is a dough recipe adapted from Madame
 Wong's Long Life Chinese Cookbook:

  -------------------
  Buns (Basic Recipe)
  -------------------

 1 package dried yeast or 1 cake fresh yeast
 1 cup lukewarm water
 4 1/2 cups flour
 1/4 cup sugar
 2 tablespoons Crisco or vegetable oil
 1/2 cup boiling water
 2 tablespoons sesame oil (dark Oriental kind)

 Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water.  Add 1 cup of flour.  Mix
 thoroughly.  cover with cloth.  Let rise 1 hour, until bubbles appear.

 Dissolve sugar and vegetable oil in 1/2 cup boiling water.  Stir well.
 Cool until lukewarm.  Pour into yeast mixture.  Add 3 1/3 cups flour.

 Knead dough on lightly floured board until smooth.  Put into extra

 large greased bowl in a warm place.  cover with damp cloth.  Let rise
 until double in bulk, about 2 hours.

 Divide into 2 portions.  Remove first portion and knead 2 minutes.
 Repeat with second.  Roll each into a roll 12 inches long and 2 inches
 wide.  Cut into 12 pieces (24 total).

 Flatten each piece with palm of hand.  Roll with rolling pin into
 3-inch circles.


 Brush with sesame oil.  Indent middle of circle with chopstick.  (At
 this point, add filling if desired.)

 Close dough around filling (if using); otherwise fold circle in half so
 that it becomes a half moon then crimp edges tightly with a fork.

 Place each bun on separate square piece of foil (or waxed paper) on
 steamer tray.  Cover tray with towel.  Let buns rise to double in bulk,
 about 30 minutes.  Remove towel.

 Steam tightly covered over briskly boiling water for 10 minutes.

 (May be prepared in advance.  May be frozen.  Thaw out in plastic bag
 and re-steam 10 minutes.)

 Keywords: recipe vegan/coconut-rice


 Hi!

 I saw your posting and I know of a South-Indian dish, very traditional

 sort of fitting your description, that is called Coconut rice.

 Recipe follows:

 1) Making of seasoning powder:

 First take about 10-15 red chillies, a teaspoon of Thania(Celantro)
 seeds, Channa dal ( I am sorry that all names are Indian, you can
 probably get these in any Indian Grocery store) and fry them in a pan
 with very little oil. Add some Asfotedia for aroma. Put about 2 table
 spoons of channa dal.( I forgot the quantity earlier). Then grind them
 coarsely on a blender, remember the channa dal should not be in whole
 pieces.) Keep this aside for garnishing.


 2) Take a freshly broken coconut and grate them up for about 2 cups.

 3) Cook white rice in a cooker, add less water than actually written in
 the instructions. Cook about 4 cups of it, add 6 cups of water to it. I
 prefer Adolphus brand Long Grain white rice.

 4) In a frying pan put about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat

 it.  Put some mustard seeds and let it burst, then add a little
 turmeric powder.  To this add 1 teaspoon of Channa Dal and Urad Dal and
 fry till golden yellow.  Add some finely split red chillies and green
 chillies as required.  Then add in the grated coconut and stir for
 about 10 secs. Then add the rice to this mixture away from the fire and
 mix thoroughly. Add salt to taste.  Add 2 teaspoons of seasoning
 mixture to the rice and stir.  If you could lay your hands on some
 coconut oil add a teaspoonful for aroma.  Garnish with some freshly cut
 Celantro leaves and some bay leaves.

 5) This is ready to be served with chips or pickle as side dish.  Or
 you can make come chatni by grinding finely some coconut with green
 chillies and celantro with water for consistency. Add salt to taste.


 PS:
 Add 1 teaspoon of chilli powder when frying the items if you could not make
 the seasoning powder.
 Reduce the number of chillies used if you want it to be less hot.
 Reduce the amount of oil initially while frying if you want it less fattening.


 Try this recipe and let me know the results.

 Bye.

    I make a strawberry/banana pie thats very simple.

  2 Bananas sliced
  1 1/2 qt strawberries sliced
 (reserve at least 2 of the biggest ones for garnish)
  Graham cracker crust
  Strawberry Glaze

 To save time I usually buy the crust and the glaze.  But you can get
 the recipe for the crust off the back of a graham cracker box.  As far
 as the glaze goes maybe someone on the net has a recipe for this.  I
 just find it easier to use it from the store.  It's mostly made of
 sugar. It can usually be found next to the Strawberries.

  Start with the bananas and layer them on the bottom, then layer the
 strawberries on top.  Continue doing this until the pie is full.

  Pour the glaze on top so it covers the pie and the fruit on the bottom
 is covered.  For a small pie just 1 jar of glaze for a large one 2.

   Refrigerate for 5-6 hours. Garnish with the strawberries and serve
 with whipped cream.

     Variation:

    Add sliced Kiwi as a third layer.

   It is a very refreshing summer treat!

 I don't know if it's German, but one of my favorite cucumber salads is

 to take thinly sliced cucumbers and onions (separate into rings) and
 let them sit in a "dressing" of vinegar (plain old white vinegar), some
 water, and a pinch of sugar. (No, no amounts. As long as there's enough
 to cover all the cucumbers and onions.) Let sit an indefinite amount of
 time in the refrigerator, from 10 minutes to overnight. Enjoy.

 This is supposed to be on the very sour side.

 Here is an additional recipe for Dahl, which I feel obliged to share
 with you all since several people tell me it is the best dahl they have
 ever had.  Anyway....

 Ingredients:  1.5 cups masoor dahl (orange in colour).
   Vegetable oil
   3 dried red peppers

    1 tsp mustard seed   (tsp = teaspoon)
   0.25 tsp asafoetida
   1 medium onion
   1.5 tsp coriander powder
   0.5 tsp turmeric powder
   salt to taste.

 Put dahl in about 3 cups water and let boil. It normally takes about an
 hour for the dahl to break up and pulp, however what I do is to start
 soaking it in water before I leave for work. This way it takes much
 less time to cook when boiled later. (gas, electricity SAVINGS!!)

 Spice Mixture: (To be added when dahl is about 80% cooked or even
 earlier if you like) Slice the onion into thin slices. Heat the oil in
 a frying pan, when hot, add red chilies and mustard seeds. After seeds
 pop, add the asafoetida, and immediately turn down the heat. Add the
 onions, start frying on low heat until they are "transparent", then
 turn up heat until they are quite brown, but not burnt black. Add
 coriander & turmeric and turn down heat. After a minute, add about 0.5
 cup of the boiling dahl mixture to the frying pan and stir
 energetically so that the spice mixture gets mixed well, and onions
 break up.


 Pour it back into the dahl pot, add salt, cook for another 10 minutes
 or until dahl is done, whichever comes later.

 Eat with rice, and tastes good with Patak's Garlic Pickle or Patak's
 Prawn Balichow on the side.

       Enjoy,

 One of my favorite lentil dishes is Dahl, I boil equal amounts of brown
 rice and (green) lentils with 2.5 times as much water, an onion, and
 whatever spices I feel like (curry is especially good) for ~45mins.
 This is good served hot with some steamed veggies or as a bases of a
 non-meat loaf.  If you have red lentils I would suggest using white
 rice since the cooking times would match better.

 I also use lentils homemade soups since they don't have to be soaked

 Here are two basic recipes:

 Basic cooked dal
 ================

 Use about 1/2 cup dal per person; you can make lots and freeze some.
 Spread dal on a dishtowel and sort over for pebbles.  Some imported dal
 is really dirty.  Place in colander and rinse well.  Set in a bowl of
 water to soak for at least half an hour or as long as overnight.

 Saute chopped onion in some oil; use about 1/2 - 1 onion per cup of
 dal.  Add finely grated ginger (1 tsp or more per cup of dal) and
 pressed or chopped garlic (at least 4 cloves per cup of dal--I use
 more). Saute about one minute, then add dal, some tumeric, some salt,
 and lots of water.  Simmer until dal is very tender--cooking time will
 vary.  The resulting mixture should have the thickness of thick, lumpy
 gravy (sounds yummy, huh?).  If you like, after the dal is all cooked,
 add a *tiny* amount of tamarind concentrate.

 The dal is, and is supposed to be, not all that spicy.  It usually
 accompanies a spicier dish.  For simplicity, you can serve it with just
 spicy pickles and rice.


 Achar (peppered radish)
 =======================

 Ingredients:
 Daikon radish
 cooking oil
 salt
 tamarind
 yellow mustard seeds
 cumin seeds
 tumeric
 red pepper (cayenne or crushed red pepper)

 Wash daikon radish and cut into big french-fry shapes.  In a large pan,
 heat a small amount of oil. When hot, add a couple of tablespoons of
 yellow mustard seeds.  These will start to crackle and pop.  Let them

 pop for about 30 seconds, and then add a couple of teaspoons of cumin
 seeds.  These will crackle too; watch carefully to see that they don't
 burn.  Lower heat slightly and add radish, a sprinkling of tumeric, a
 very small amount of water, a dash of red pepper, a little salt, and
 quite a bit of tamarind.  I use about a tablespoon for a couple of
 pounds of radish--we make this in quantity.  Stir until ingredients are
 well mixed.  Cook until radish is just heated, but still very crisp.
 Radish should not be limp or soggy.  Serve hot or cold.  Yes, you eat
 the seeds, too.

 My husband says you can make potatoes this way too, but the potatoes
 need to be cooked all the way through.  I would pre-cook them in the
 microwave to speed things up.


 I selected these recipes because I think the techniques and spicing
 fairly are representative.  The cook-seeds-in-oil trick is common, as
 is the garlic-onions-ginger mixture.

 Don't be shy with the spices, but be aware that black pepper gets
 hotter as it cooks longer, and too much tumeric can make food bitter.

 Lastly, here is a great recipe for salsa sauce which I got from a
 Californian friend of mine (Lynne Deal) recently.

                        DEAL'S CALIFORNIAN SALSA
                       --------------------------


 4 *large* tomatoes - *ripe*, peeled, seeded + chopped (see below)
 1 tablespoon seeded, finely chopped *hot* peppers
 2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro
 1 small red onion, finely chopped
 1 large clove garlic, finely chopped
 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar (or lemon juice)
 1 teaspoon salt

 To peel tomatoes, immerse in boiling water for *less* than 1 minute,
 then plunge into ice water and the skin will slip off. Squeeze out seeds,
 chop.

 Balance of ingredients is according to taste, especially the chilis. Try
 *lots* of cilantro and garlic and add chopped red and green sweet peppers.

 Keywords: recipe vegan/dianes-eggplant


 Here's a recipe that takes some time, but well worth the effort.

 1/2 bushel of hot red peppers
 1/2 bushel of red and green sweet peppers
 1 head garlic (that is the entire head, not one clove and use a very large
 head)
 fresh mint--about a good colandar full--washed and leaves removed from the
 stem
 olive oil
 approximately 1/2 bushel medium to medium large eggplants

 clean and seed the peppers.  clean the paper from the garlic.  wash the
 mint.  remove the leaves from the stems.  Pass the peppers, garlic and
 mint through a meat grinder on medium fine grind.  Set aside.  *they
 will begin to form juice which you should drain before using*.  This


 can be done a day ahead before using and then refrigerated or you can
 do this right before using the mixture.

 wash the eggplants, remove the stem and blossom ends then slice into
 1/2" slices.  Alternately layer the slices of eggplant and canning salt
 on a large drain board--either one with holes in it or one that
 slightly slants.  You don't need too much salt--just sprinkle a little
 bit on each slice.  Then place a large board on top-- large enough to
 cover all the layers of eggplant and place a heavy on top of the board.
 I use an 8 quart pot filled with water.  The eggplants will begin to
 *weep*.  Let them sit like this overnight or about 24 hours.  Remove
 the weight and the board--the eggplants should be pressed thin.  Use a
 paper towel wipe off the excess moisture and salt.

 In a heavy pan, lightly fry each slice in the olive oil.  Don't use too
 much as the eggplant really absorbs the oil.

 In a heavy crock make alternate layers of fried eggplant slices and the
 pepper mixture.  When the crock is about 3/4 full, cover all with a
 good virgin or extra virgin olive oil.  Cover with a lid that will fit
 inside the crock and set a weight on the lid so that a little oil comes
 over the lid.  Store in a cool dark place and they will be ready to eat
 in a few weeks.

 If you would rather not store them in a crock, then alternate the
 layers of eggplant and pepper mixture as before but in a baking dish.
 Place two stacks of eggplants/pepper in a small freezer bag and some

 extra pepper mixture and freeze.  To serve, take them out of the
 freezer about 4-5 hours before using.  Gently pull the pieces apart as
 they thaw.  Then cover with olive oil and a little garlic salt or salt
 and peppers to taste.  They will absorb more oil as they sit.  Add more
 if you wish.

 These are great.  They are tangy but not hot, even when we have used
 peppers that actually caused blisters on our hands when cleaning them.
 They're great as a meat condiment, part of a relish try, mixed with
 tomato slices and used as a salad.  My husband and I like to make
 sandwiches with them and some salami.  If you are looking for a
 different taste, use cider vinegar instead of the olive oil to cover
 the eggplant as this slightly pickles them.  When ready to serve drain
 however many slices you want to use then mix them will a small amount
 of olive oil and some seasonings.  A great salad.

 I'm sorry I'm so vague about how much oil to use or how much mint.  this is
 a very old family recipe, my great-grandmother made these and I'm well over
 40.  We really eyeball the amounts and adjust the garlic and mint according
 to how strong they are.

 I hope you enjoy

 Keywords: recipe vegan dosai


 (Verbose, designed to guide the novice through the steps).


 Dosai (South Indian, Pancake-like)
 =====


 Ingredients:

 3 cups of Texas long grain rice
 1 cup of urad dal (available in Indian grocery stores).
    (Buy the polished kind, not the unpolished one with the outer black layer)
 salt to taste (about 2 tsp)

 Method:

 GRINDING:

 Soak the rice and the dal separately, for about 5 hours (soaking longer
 won't hurt, I usually soak it in the morning, go off to work, and grind
 in the evening.) Grind the rice with sufficient water until it is a
 smooth paste. (I use my osterizer and run it in 3 batches, the amount
 of water used to grind is somewhat crucial, using too much will make
 the result too watery, while using too little will make it hard to
 grind and too thick. I usually put in the rice and add water until it
 just reaches the brim of the rice, this will seem like too much, but it
 will work out fine once the rice is ground.  I then run the osterizer
 on MIX until the rice is broken and then run it on LIQUIDIZE until the
 rice starts to become a paste.  If required, add just a little more
 water, perhaps a few tablespoons.  Touch the paste between your fingers
 to feel the texture. It should be smooth).

 Now grind the dal in two batches. (The amount of water here is not as
 tricky. Traditionally this would be ground in a stone grinder by hand.
 The dal needs to be ground while slowly adding more water from the top
 of the osterizer. When ground, the dal has the tendency to fluff up,
 this tendency must be encouraged by adding only a little water at a

 time while stirring and continuing to grind.  The dal should double in
 quantity after grinding, while the quantity of rice would have remained
 unchanged.) Now mix both the pastes with the salt in a dish that is at
 least a third bigger in size, allowing space for the dough to rise.
 (Quite commonly, the dough runs over for me, so I put it in a larger
 dish than worry all night about overflowing dough).  Leave for about 8
 hours in a dark warm place. I usually leave it in the oven overnight
 and occasionally turn the oven on for a minute or two, to keep the air
 inside the oven at a warm temperature.

 COOKING:

 The next morning, if you have done all this, the dough is ready to be
 transformed into dosas. Use a heavy cast-iron griddle (a flat non-stick
 pan will do, but sadly lacks the taste that comes from the iron pan).
 Heat the pan until a few drops of water dropped on the pan sizzles away
 Take a deep ladle full of dough and drop the dough in the middle of the
 pan, then with a deftness that comes with practice, quickly swirl the
 dough away from the middle until it is spread evenly in a circle around
 the pan. You must do this quickly because once the dough cooks, you
 cannot spread it and the result will be lumpy.  Take a teaspoon full of
 oil and spread it around the edge of the dosai.  Wait a minute or so,
 until you see the edges browning and insert a flat ladle that has sharp
 edges under and all around the dosai, until it is released completely

 (Bewarned that, using a well-scrubbed pan won't let you release the
 dosai easily. To prevent this, you might want to rub a little oil onto

 the surface of the pan before spreading the dough.)

 After releasing the dosai, flip it around on the other side and put
 another teaspoon of oil around the edges. Wait a minute or two until
 it is cooked and remove from the pan.

 Before making the next one, use a small piece of paper kitchen towel
 and rub any excess oil off the pan.

 (This whole procedure sounds tedious, but its not too hard after you've
 done it a few times. Incidentally I make dosa every week. The dough
 will keep in the refrigerator for a week or more.  If the dough starts
 to get sour, cut small pieces some green chilis and onion and add to
 the dough before cooking it.  This can be done even otherwise, for a
 different flavor and variety.)

 To eat:

 Break a piece of the dosa and dip it into the dosa-molaga-podi
 or the samber (recipes to follow) and pop it into youir mouth.


 Enjoy. If you do try to make this, send me email if you have any
 further questions.

 Keywords: recipe vegan dosai molaga podi


 A powdery substance that is traditionally eaten with dosai or idlis.

 Dosai Molaga podi (Literally translated, "Dosai Chili Powder")

 =================

 Ingredients:

 1/2 cup urad dal
 1/2 cup chana dal
 asafoetida (a little)
 tamarind (dry or fry it also) (cannot use the paste)
 1/4 cup coriander seeds to taste ( I found 1/4 cup a little too much,
                                    reduce slightly)
 jaggery (little bit) (molasses?)
 salt (to taste)
 red chillies (to desired taste)
 1/4 cup sesame seed (preferable the white kind)

 Method:

 Fry til in a dry pan, and the others in a little oil separately, until
 red (don't wait until it gets too dark).  Powder all ingredients finely
 and the two dals slightly coarsely and mix all together.  Note on the
 amount of red chilies to use-- I usually fry and grind red chilis
 separately (this needs to be done with sufficient ventilation in the
 kitchen), and then keep adding this to the mixture of the other

 ingredients until desired level of heat tolerance.  I can always use
 any leftover in other recipes that calls for red chili powder.

 Note: This makes a batch that you can keep around for a few months.
       Store in normal air-tight glass bottle or plastic container.

 How to eat the dosai with this:

 Add a little oil to a little podi and mix, the dosa in then dipped into
 this oil-podi mixture, to smear it with this mixture and then popped
 into the mouth. Using the fingers is the preferred way here.  (This is
 not unlike the way the Ethiopian bread Injera is eaten).
