Cut the beef into 1/2-inch cubes, discarding the bone and fat.  In a Dutch oven,
melt the margarine and add the meat, stirring to brown on all sides.  Remove the
meat cubes as they brown.  Saute the onion and garlic in the drippings until
they are soft.  Stir in the paprika, salt, and caraway seeds; cook for 1 minute.
Stir in the meat, Coca-Cola, wine, and tomatoes.  Cover tightly; simmer about
1-1/2 hours or until the meat is fork-tender.

In a bowl, blend the flour with a little water to make a smooth paste; stir into
goulash.  Serve with hot noodles.  Makes 8 servings (about 6 cups).
