Project # 67  SEED A 1200 SQ. FT. LAWN

    Seeding a lawn is the epitome of 'grunt work'.  Lawn seed and fertilizer 
are not cheap but they seem inexpensive when compared with the cost of the 
labor it takes to grade the topsoil and then spread the seed and fertilizer 
with a push spreader.  You can save more than half of what a landscaper 
charges if you do-it-yourself. 

    To seed a 1200 sq. ft. area a landscape contractor will charge upwards of 
$570.  You can purchase the seed and fertilizer and rent a spreader for $275.  
If you need to remove the existing lawn or the yard needs extensive grading, 
it will cost you considerably more time and money.  A normal job should take 
you two days. 

    Follow up watering is an important part of this job.  Your investment in 
seed and time will dry up and blow away if you neglect your emerging grass.
