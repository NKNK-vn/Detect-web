    The following recipe produces a gallon of syrup very similar to Coca-Cola's.
Mix 2,400 grams of sugar with just enough water to dissolve (high-fructose corn
syrup may be substituted for half the sugar).  Add 37 grams of caramel, 3.1
grams of caffeine, and 11 grams of phosphoric acid.  Extract the cocaine from
1.1 grams of coca leaf (Truxillo growth of coca preferred) with toluol; discard
the cocaine extract.  Soak the coca leaves and kola nuts (both finely powdered;
0.37 gram of kola nuts) in 22 grams of 20 percent alcohol.  California white
wine fortified to 20 percent strength was used as the soaking solution circa
1909, but Coca-Cola may have switched to a simple water/alcohol mixture.  After
soaking, discard the coca and the kola and add the liquid to the syrup.  Add 30
grams of lime juice (a former ingredient, evidently, that Coca-Cola now denies)
or a substitute such as a water solution of citric acid and sodium citrate at
lime-juice strength.  Mix together 0.88 gram of lemon oil, 0.47 gram of orange
oil, 0.27 gram of lime oil, 0.20 gram of cassia (Chinese cinnamon) oil, 0.07
gram of nutmeg oil, and if desired, traces of coriander, lavender, and neroli
oils, and add to 4.9 grams of 95 percent alcohol.  Shake.  Add 2.7 grams of
water to the alcohol/oil mixture and let stand for twenty-four hours at about 60
degrees Fahrenheit.  A cloudy layer will separate.  Take off the clear part of
the liquid only and add to the syrup.  Add 19 grams of glycerin (from vegetable
sources, not hog fat, so the drink can be sold to Orthodox Jews and Moslems) and
1.5 grams of vanilla extract.  Add water (treated with chlorine) to make 1
gallon of syrup.

    Yield (used to flavor carbonated water): 128 6.5-ounce bottles.
