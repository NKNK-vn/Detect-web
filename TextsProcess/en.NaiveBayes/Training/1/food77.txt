Recipe:   Carmel Candies (Wertherlike)
Posted by:     Commissioner
Quantity: ??

Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, melted        1 cup sugar
5 Tbsp. water                 1/4 tsp. salt

Instructions:
Place in a heavy saucepan, all ingredients.
Cook, stirring, to hard crack on candy thermometer.
Pour onto a buttered pan. (I use a pizza pan)
Let harden and crack with a knife handle or something like
that.

Comments:
If you like, you can cover the toffee with melted chocolate
and nuts before cracking it.  A good way to do this is to
pour some chocolate chips onto the toffee after it sets up
but is still warm.  The heat of the toffee willmelt the
chips.  Just spread it around after it melts.
