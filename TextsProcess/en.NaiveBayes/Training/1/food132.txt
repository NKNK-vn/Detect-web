Comments:
This  stuff  will keep for a long time.  It is  a  great
basic paste to use in cooking.
ONE APPLICATION:  Thin with 1/2 vinegar 1/2 water (to as
thin  as you think reasonable - gamble here and use your
judgement!)  then put it in an old shaker bottle => homeade
pepper sauce.
Mr. Q says you can simulate space travel if you place a huge
glob of this sauce on a chip or cracker and eat it all in
one bite!
Notice: the "heat" of jalapenos can and does vary widely,
you can get  mild results one time and sear the hide off
your tongue  the next.  A little experimentation is
suggested to avoid killing the dinner  guests.   (generally
I am selfish with  such  concoctions anyway)
Ok,  folks.   What's  the first bid for my  recipe  for
homemade refried black beans. (World BEST burritos!)     NOW
THAT'S SPICY FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(PLEASE!!! these little lovelies are pronounced  'hal-a-pen-
yoes'  there is no J sound also - there is a ~ over the N)
PLEASE NOTE: ALL mention of peppers means FRESH produce but
by  all  means try canned/pickled if that is  all  you  have
available.  The results however will NOT be comparable.
