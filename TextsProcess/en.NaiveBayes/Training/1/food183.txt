===============> S H U I   M A I  DUMPLINGS <===============

From South China, 'Dumplings' are a misnomer, I believe.  These
are really 'open-faced' won tons.  Or, at least, best made from
won ton skins or wrappers or their round kin 'gyoza' skins.
Occasionally, I've seen recipes where the pastry for Shui Mai
was made from a dumpling dough recipe and this may be the
source of the confusion.

Shui mai are usually open along their top side, sitting flatly
with their ends pinched closed.  They are always steamed once
the filling is added.  Since this process doesn't enhance the
color of the wrapper, the fillings are sometimes chosen for their
colors as well as flavor.

Two types of fillings SAVORY and SWEET are used.  Thus, they are
very similar to Won Tons.

I recommend buying the won ton skins or the gyoza round skins
for Shui Mai.  However, you can make your own.

Below is a sample recipe for 'skins':

*****************************
SKINS              makes: 24
*****************************

2 + 1/2 c. flour
1/2 c. water, boiling
1/4 c. water, cold
1 Tbls. lard or shortening


1. Put 2 cups of flour in a bowl. Reserve remainder.
2. Add boiling water and mix well.
3. Add lard and cold water.
4. Knead into a smooth dough. Use reserved flour as necessary.
5. Form into 'french bread' long loaf.
6. Cut into 24 pieces.
7. Roll into a thin two inch circle.  Repeat with all pieces.

Below are directions for finishing Shui Mai:


***************************************************************
GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND COOKING OF SHUI MAI
***************************************************************


1. Place a 'skin' across a hollow 'ring' made by your index finger
   meeting the tip of your thumb.
2. Using a 'soup' type spoon place a reasonable amount of filling
   on the gyoza skin.
3. Depress the filling and skin through the 'ring' leaving an opening
   at the top edge.
4. Set shui mai with the open side up, like a boat, or drawstring purse.
5. Press down the filling so it is smooth.

Your shui mai should look something like this:

                    ...........
                 ../ filling   \.
                /  \.........../ \
               /__________________\


6. At this point you can add a green pea or some chopped ham,
   crab, mushrooms, scrambled egg, or seaweed in the top
   opening for color if you want.

7. In some cases, you can use cabbage, lettuce, or other leaf as
   a base upon which to set the filling.  Thus, there is no skin
   used at all to hold the meat ball.


Assemble all of them before the next step.

STEAMING:

8. Put a good amount of water in your wok.  Bring to a boil.
9. Lightly oil the rack or bamboo steamer basket so shui mai
   won't stick while steaming. Can also use a cloth.
10. Place basket or rack in wok above boiling water.
11. Place filled shui mai on rack and cover tightly with wok
    lid.
12. Steam 5 to 10 minutes or till done.
13. Remove from wok and serve in steaming basket.


All the recipes in this file require you to use either gyoza or
won ton skins for the appetizers.  Be sure you have enough on
hand.

The shrimp used in the recipes in this file is uncooked.

8. Bring the opposite edges together at mid point and seal tightly.
   Leave most of these edges open except right at the center.
9. Now bring the open ends in toward the center till they meet
   the mid point where the sides are joined.  Seal the ends to
   that mid point. Be sure to leave four openings along these
   edges you have joined. Shape them if necessary.
10. Dust the top of each opening with a different topping so there
    are four different colors on this Shui Mai.  Repeat.
11. Steam and serve.

   form a shape similar to a taco or noodle yet open at the new
   ends.
7. Now fold together, again, bringing the two open ends toward
   the sealed mid point. Folding these two ends toward the middle
   should flatten them to a fan shape. Hold a finger on each side
   of the mid point as you draw the open ends up with other fingers.
   Don't attach the open ends to the mid point or seal the opening
   closed.
8. With this new folded shape, the points of the flattened open
   ends of the opposite sides will be near each other and should
   be sealed together.
9. You should have two long cresents of filling surrounding the
   two smaller ovals which form the pupils of the 'eye'.
10. Dust the ovals with the toppings.
11. Steam and serve.
