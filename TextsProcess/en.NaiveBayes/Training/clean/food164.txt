In a large pan, place the meat, water, salt, small onion, celery leaves, and bay
leaf.  Cover and simmer about 2-1/2 hours until the meat is tender. Remove the
meat.  Strain the broth (should measure 2 quarts).  Add ice cubes to the broth
to harden the fat and remove the fat.  Discard the fat.

Finely dice the meat, discarding any fat and bones (should be about 2 cups).  In
a 5 to 6 quart kettle or Dutch oven, combine the beef broth and the meat.  Place
over low heat while preparing the rest of the ingredients.

Pan-fry the bacon until crisp.  Add the bacon and the drippings and all the
remaining ingredients, except Parmesan cheese, to the broth.  Cover and simmer
about 30 minutes, until the vegetables and macaroni are tender.  Serve sprinkled
with Parmesan cheese, if desired.  Makes about 3 quarts.
