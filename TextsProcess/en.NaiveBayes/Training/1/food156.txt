   Here's the peanut butter cookie recipe that even my friends who don't like
peanut butter cookies like.

  1/2 cup soft shortening                    1 egg
  1/2 cup peanut butter                      1 1/4 cups flour
  1/2 cup granulated sugar                   1/2 tsp. baking powder
  1/2 cup brown sugar (packed)               3/4 tsp. baking soda
                                             1/4 tsp. salt

  Mix shortening, peanut butter, sugars, and egg thoroughly.  Measure flour by
dip-level-pour method.  Mix rest of ingredients and stir in.  Chill dough.
Heat oven to 375 F.  Roll dough into balls the size of large walnuts.  Place 3"
apart on lightly greased cookie sheet.  Flatten, crisscross fashion, with a
fork dipped in flour.  Bake 10-12 min. or until set but not hard.  makes about
3 dozen 2 1/2" cookies.

   I usually don't chill the dough, but it does make it easier to flatten.
Also, there is enough grease in the dough that it's not really necessary to
grease the cookie sheet.
