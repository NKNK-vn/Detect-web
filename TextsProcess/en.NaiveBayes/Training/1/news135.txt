                      THE CASE OF EDWARD AUSTIN SINGH

Here is a fairly old but not publicised enough article on a famous hacker. One
single Sunday afternoon a programmmer remained preoccupied at Guildford 
University in England.  His name, Edward Austin Singh. His preoccuption
included browsing through computer files on a military network in the 
United States, He was connected to another computer in Germany via the one
in America, his satellite link crossed and recrossed the Atlantic, He was once
again Hacking into an important system. That day at 7.10pm he was caught by a
detective Superintendent and a detective inspector of Scotland Yard's serious 
crime squad whom walked in and passed across their police identification 
cards. Singh  had no choice but to admit to all his computer crimes.  He 
explained to them that he would break into systems by one particular sceme 
that worked very well. He wrote a capture program that grabbed people's
passwords.  They thought it was just the terminal asking for their passwords,
but it stored them and Singh would collect them later. During his exploration,
the more he hacked, the more hackers he came into contact with, always 
leaving messages or answering queries on various Bulletin Boards and chat
systems.  Singh penitreted these systems completely, in most cases he could
gain super-user or system manager privileges and he got into everything
connected up to the network. If Singh couldn't get into a system then all he 
would do was contact someone else through another Bulletin Board and they 
would help him. While he was browsing through various boards, he found valid
credits cards with numbers on them, so thanks to hackers like Singh we were
all able to start `Phreaking'. He had broken into NASA and examined details of
a project which was being planned, it included details of an unmanned mission
to Mars!  He also found his way into Nuclear power stations and he explored a 
space defence centre operated by a US government arms manufacturer. 
There was no system in the whole world which could keep him out!  When he
was bored, he would break into a system and put a back door into it and he 
would send messages to the Sysop telling him that he had been penetrated by 
hackers, then he would wait and see if the Sysop could keep him out. Usually 
they just changed the passwords and never found the back door. It is amazing
to know that half of the people that run these systems have absolutely no idea 
what the hell is going on! Operations to catch Singh were going on for at least
 six months by the United States Secret Service. But even Singh already knew 
that they were onto him before he was caught, because of a message left on a 
BBS by another hacker warning him that the US head office was awaring of 
Hacking in his general area and they had isolated him and wanted his name. 
Many System owners became very unhappy when Singh admitted to, and showed how 
he broke into those Systems because some of them appeared to be absolutely 
vulnerable to infiltration. 
When Singh was arreseted he estimated that he had about 250 systems under his 
control, which were computer sites that he could enter anytime again at his own 
will. 
Beleive it or not, Singh's did not recieve any punishment for all of his 
activities! he got let off with a strict warning! 
Also, to his good fortune of being caught he obtained a job as a software 
security consultant. `You have to be a hacker to catch a hacker' one has 
always said. 
Singh's main goal, before he was caught was total world domination! He wanted 
everything under his very own control.  It was the ULTIMATE game on the 
ULTIMATE scale.  He got a thrill out of beating the systems, and having so 
much power. 
Saying that Singh was obsessed was a gross understatement! (aren't we all
obsessed in one way or another when dealing with computers?) The sheer 
scope of fraud, espionage and damage had never been greater. Singh was 
one of the best hackers in this generation, although his efforts breaking
into alot of systems were not all that hard to achieve.  But it involved a 
lot of time, patience and instinct which Singh seemed to have as a second 
nature. Hacking is not only a past-time, but for many people it is an 
art-form.
