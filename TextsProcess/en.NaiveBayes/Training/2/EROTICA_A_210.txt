                  <<<<<Orphan Annie's 5th Adventure>>>>>
 
     Even  though we'd stopped going out a year ago, I was  still 
curious  about Norman.  He'd always been intriguing, he'd  always 
made  me  laugh and smile, and I remember his being  dynamite  in 
bed.  But he'd gotten serious about another girl (god, don't  you 
hate to compete with 18-year olds? and I'm not sure she was  even 
18)  and  without much ado I'd just made myself scarce.   No  big 
scene  a year ago, but I wasn't going to be merely  an  irregular 
Thursday-night diversion for him!
 
     But  then  just  last  week someone  had  mentioned  him  in 
passing,  in the single mode.  It wasn't "Norman and Chris,"  but 
merely  "Norman."  So I called, and knew as soon as  he  answered 
I'd got myself wrapped up again.  I loved just hearing his voice.  
He  was delighted, even over the phone he made me smile,  and  we 
eagerly set a date for a movie Friday evening.  I would come over 
to  his  place,  and I knew there was already  a  good  chance  I 
wouldn't leave until Saturday or even Sunday.
 
     When  I arrived I presented him with a bottle of wine and  a 
very  sensual kiss.  I'd dressed in tight jeans and a thin  crepe 
blouse,  and  I  could feel his hands  warmly  embrace  me  right 
through  the fabric.  We decided to start the wine--so  it  could 
breathe for later, of course--before leaving for the theater.   I 
stood  right next to him as he maneuvered the cork out,  so  he'd 
catch the perfume I'd worn for him; I know I was close enough  to 
feel  the  warmth  of his body without  even  touching  him.   We 
toasted  our good fortune and then left hand-in-hand; during  the 
drive  over  I kept my hand on his leg and he was  most  terribly 
distracted.   You  give men just the hint of sex and they  go  to 
pieces on you!
 
     In  the theater I pulled his hand over to my leg as soon  as 
the lights dimmed.  I held it down firmly as he massaged my thigh 
and then slid up to cup my mound.  He gently rubbed me so that  I 
could tell he hadn't forgotten a thing.  My legs were spread wide 
apart and I held his wrist in close to me.  Pretty soon my breath 
was  getting shorter and shorter and I had to make him stop.   My 
sigh of relief was almost audible, for I was about to come  right 
there!
 
     Then  it was my turn.  I reached down between his  legs  and 
grabbed  his balls.  I could slide my hand up his shaft and  back 
down again, and even through the heavy fabric of his jeans  could 
feel him thick and throbbing.  I kept that up for a half hour  or 
so,  and had to quit when my arm was so tired from the  contorted 
position  that my only other choice would have been to drop  down 
on  my knees between his legs; it was a hard (!) choice, but  the 
theater was too crowded to do something obvious like that.
 
     So I squeezed his thigh, let go, and sat back in the  chair, 
resting  while trying to catch up on the plot I'd been  ignoring.  
He  put  his arm around my shoulder just as the  movie  began  to 
shift  to  the romantic part of the  adventure.   Inspiration  to 
Norman!   He  let  his hand drop down my front  and  squeezed  my 
breast.   I had only a slender, thin bra on beneath the crepe  so 
that  I could feel every one of his fingers caress me, and  in  a 
very  few moments my nipples were quite erect.  He  reached  over 
and  undid a button on my blouse and slipped his hand inside.   I 
was so hot I was surprised there wasn't steam coming out, and the 
warmth  of  his  hand just reflected right back  onto  my  chest.  
Audacious  as  ever, Norman then proceeded not merely to  cup  my 
breast,  but there in the theater to slide his hand  beneath  the 
bra  cup and directly stimulate my nipple.  I was about  to  come 
right there, once again!  The sexual tension was so high I had to 
grab the armrests to keep from jumping him there in the seat!
 
     Thankfully,  the movie soon ended and we emerged  into  some 
surprisingly  cold  night air.  Well, the whole  world  was  cold 
compared  to  us! We went to get a bite to eat, where  he  and  I 
played  a  marvelous  game of footsie.  The wine  didn't  at  all 
measure  up, though, so we rushed home to where we had  something 
worth our attention(!).
 
     Norman  lit  a  fire  while I freshened up  (and  put  in  a 
diaphragm!).   When  I  returned to the living room  he  had  two 
glasses,  the wine and some pillows all arranged in front of  the 
fireplace.   I bent over and kissed him as he handed me a  glass, 
and rubbed his chest.  He grabbed my calf in reply while I sipped 
the  wine.  What a smooth, sensual bouquet! A good  beginning  to 
this part of the evening, for sure!
 
     Then we stretched out before the fire and kissed.  Gently at 
first,  our  lips just sort of nibbling on each other.   Then  we 
drew  each other closer and really explored mouths.  He  put  his 
glass down and began again on my blouse's buttons, and I likewise 
started  in on his shirt.  I soon was rubbing my hands  all  over 
his hairy chest, kissing his neck and tongueing his ears, and  he 
was  fumbling with the front closure of my bra.  Once he  had  it 
open  I rolled him onto his back, pushed his hands away  from  my 
tits and rubbed my chest directly over his.  I was so horny  now!  
With  his arms pinned to the floor I wrapped my legs  around  his 
waist and squeezed there, then ground my pelvis against his.   He 
closed his eyes and just took it like a man!
 
     When  I let his hands go they went for my butt and began  to 
massage it firmly, exploring all of it from my waist to the  tops 
of my thighs, and as he held me down I could feel him growing and 
throbbing beneath his zipper.  I lifted up and began to pull  his 
zipper down, soon exposing his shorts and then opening his  pants 
all the way so I could reach inside.  What a find!
 
     He was moist, and warm, and full of fun there!  I soon moved 
my  mouth's attentions there and took him fully between my  lips.  
He  was  tasty, too.  I started sucking, kissing,  and  squeezing 
him, all the while my hand cupping and massaging his balls.  In a 
very short while his hips were moving up and down in rhythm  with 
my  mouth  and I knew he wouldn't be long in  coming.   When  the 
spurts  came I was swallowing it all and kept sucking even  after 
he had collapsed.
 
     After  a  brief recovery, he pulled me up to  face  him.   I 
first  maneuvered his pants the rest of the way off, and then  he 
began  to work on my belt.  He had this great smile on  his  face 
that made me let him do to me whatever he wanted!  Soon, my jeans 
joined  his in a pile and his face was down between my legs,  his 
hands  on my breasts.  His tongue explored all the  crevices  and 
folds of my labia and soon I was rubbing my mound up and down his 
face, getting him thoroughly wet.  In a last spasm I collapsed in 
a  series  of  yells  and was twitching on  the  floor,  like  an 
epileptic, until I just fell asleep.
 
     I think he did too, because the next thing I remember is his 
gently shaking me, murmuring with half-closed eyes.  Whatever  he 
said, it had something to do with going to bed and I was all  too 
ready.  Somehow, with unsteady legs, I managed to stand up and we 
both sort of wobbled down the hallway, leaning on each other.  We 
didn't  get out of bed for thirty-six hours, though we must  have 
slept  no more than five.  For that night and the next  full  day 
the  only sunlight we saw was what came in through  the  curtains 
blowing at the open windows.  Well, Norman did get up to get  the 
champagne and bagels we had for breakfast, and I did have to  pay 
attention  to the contraceptive supply.  We would doze and  awake 
only  to  make  love.  Then we'd decide we  were  too  musky  (an 
oxymoron?) and go take a shower, where I'd climb up on him in the 
hot  stream and we'd screw away, my legs around his waist and  my 
arms around his neck as as I pumped away and he swayed in the hot 
water.   Then we'd towel each other off and climb back  into  bed 
where he'd eat me again.  I wholly lost track of how many times I 
came,  well  over  a  hundred.   I  was  at  once  exhausted  and 
exhilerated.  After I went home, Sunday was shot, of course,  but 
I  was exhausted for good causes:  I think I'm now bowlegged  for 
life, and I think Norman has sworn off inexperienced girls!
