===========================

THE TIME MAY COME WHEN YOU MAY WANT TO SELL YOUR COMICS. THE FOLLOWING GUIDELIN
E SHOWS YOU HOW...

-=TITLE=-
POPULAR TITLES SUCH AS THE X-MEN OR SPIDER-MAN WILL ALWAYS BRING A HIGHER PRICE

HAT KIND IS IT.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SELLING TO A DEALER OR A C
LUB.

XPECT IT TO BE VALUABLE TOMORROW.


========================

! STORING COMIC BOOKS  !
!		       !
========================

1. STORE COMICS IN BAGS MADE FROM MYLAR.
   -PLASTIC BAGS ARE GOOD ONLY FOR TEMPORARY STORAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR ACIDITY.
   -NEVER USE POLETHYLENE BAGS BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH ACID CONTENT.
2. PACK COMICS IN BOXES THAT ARE TO THEIR DIMENSIONS.
   -NEVER STACK COMICS.
   -TOO LARGE OF BOXES WILL COST COMICS TO SAG AND THUS BEND.
3. NEVER READ A COMIC MORE THAN ONCE.
   -EACH TIME YOU READ IT, THE MORE IT IS SOILED AND THE LESS VALUABLE IT IS.
   -IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU BUY 2 COPIES; 1 TO READ, THE OTHER TO KEEP.
4. NEVER STORE IN DIRECT LIGHT.
   -SUNLIGHT WILL RUIN COMICS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.
5. KEEP UPRIGHT IN A DARK COOL PLACE.
