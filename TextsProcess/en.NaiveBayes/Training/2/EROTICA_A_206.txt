                  <<<<<Orphan Annie's 1st Adventure>>>>>
 
     This last weekend was a surprise for me, the first time  I'd     
"done" a married man (though god knows I've looked at 'em in  the     
past!).  When it was all through, though, he could say he'd still     
been (mostly) faithful.
 
     I  threw this small party for a dozen or so  friends  Friday 
night,  sort of a kickoff for the July 4 weekend.  John  came  up 
from  The  City,  on  his way to  the  Sierras  for  a  weekend's 
backpacking, something his wife never really liked.  I think  she 
went  home to mother, or somesuch.  Anyhow, the party went  late, 
and  when it was breaking up, John asked if he could stay on  the 
sleeper in the living room, rather than try to drive on at  night 
to a dark campground.  I said sure.
 
     John  and  I made up the sleeper and then I went to  take  a 
shower.   When  I  came out, in my robe, he was in  the  bed  and 
reading. I said goodnight and turned to head for my bedroom  when 
he made some funny comment about what he'd just read.  I  laughed 
too, and went over to see more.  When he showed me the article, I 
recognized it and we started talking.  I was soon sitting on  the 
side of his bed, listening and watching.  As I looked I  realized 
what  a real cutie he really was--all that dark hair, the  strong 
shoulders  (all I could see of his body), and those  great  teeth 
that showed when he smiled.  I got to thinking what a great  find 
his  wife had.  Then, somehow, he made some gesture and his  hand 
ended up on my leg--and I really don't know how to explain  this, 
but  my hand suddenly went there on top of his.  He looked at  me 
funny  and  gave me a gentle squeeze as he tried  to  pull  away, 
which  I returned.  He smiled and said, "Ann, I can't.   Really."  
You know, The Speech.
 
     I  just murmured and bent down to kiss him.  Of course,  the 
robe  fell open and of course his hand went inside it  and  about 
halfway  through the kiss I knew we were in trouble.  We sort  of 
stayed that way for a while and then I moved my legs up onto  the 
bed.   His hand went from my side to my back, and his other  hand 
went  to my butt, stroking it gently.  I pulled the  covers  from 
under  me and ran my hand down his chest and across his  stomach.  
He was so strong, too!  I nibbled on his ear and he just moaned.
 
     Well, this was fun and all that, but he was right, he WAS (I 
mean,  "is") married, after all.  His hand was now on  my  breast 
and  I  was going to have to decide something, soon.   I  made  a 
decision, sat up, and then swung my leg over to straddle him.  He 
looked disappointed as I sat up, and then delighted as I moved my 
leg across his body.  He was on his back and I was sitting across 
his thighs.
 
     Now  he  could  put both hands on my  breasts.   He  was  so 
strong, and yet so gentle!  His hands just sort of came up my rib 
cage  and  stroked my breasts from underneath to the  nipple.   I 
found I could sort of sag into his palms.  I grabbed his cock and 
began  to  stroke it, and then every once in a while,  needing  a
little  oral contact, I bent down and kissed him or let him  suck 
my tits.  I was warm all over and every part of him I touched was 
warm, too.
 
     Then  his  hand went around and began to play with  my  butt 
again.   I  lifted myself up and moved up until  I  was  directly 
above  his cock.  I was really wet by now and could feel  my  cum 
running out.  I set my pussy on his balls and just stroked it  up 
his  shaft.  Up, lift, back, down, again and again. His cock  was 
really  getting wet!  He just moaned, and then moved his hand  to 
grab  both my cheeks.  He tried to move me just that bit  farther 
up to where he could slide in, and I really wanted to, but I knew 
things would be different tomorrow and next week.  "No," I  said, 
"but wait."  He was getting even longer and really throbbing!
 
     His hand began alternating from my breasts to my butt.   His 
legs went up and then down, and I could feel his pelvis thrusting 
in  time  to my stroking.  His eyes were squeezed shut  and  that 
great smile of his was all across his face!
 
     I  could  feel myself throbbing, too.  I was  working  up  a 
sweat  (I  almost laughed out loud when I realized I'd  now  need 
ANOTHER shower!) but he felt so good beneath me I couldn't  stop.  
My  clit  was bumping the top of his cock every time  I  slid  up 
there  and  I was just about out  of  control  until--THERE!--and 
there again!--and again!--I was coming and the contractions  just 
wouldn't stop.  I collapsed onto him, with my legs wrapped around 
his  thighs  and my feet tucked between his  calves,  my  breasts 
crushed against his chest, and his hands stroking my butt and  my 
back.   I really don't think he came, but he was  looking  really 
good!   Besides, it was too wet down there to really tell in  the 
half light.
 
     I  would have loved to stay all night. But, like I said,  he 
was  married  and  it just wouldn't do to have  SLEPT  with  him.  
After  a few moments I tore myself away and staggered back to  my 
bed,  firmly and quietly shutting the door behind me  (no  ideas, 
John!).
 
     I  was  asleep  almost  before I was in  my  own  bed  (cold 
sheets!).  When I awoke, it was late Sunday morning and John  was 
gone.   He'd stripped the bed and left a pile of  musky  smelling 
sheets.  I'm sure he had to hike a few extra miles to get me  out 
of his system!
