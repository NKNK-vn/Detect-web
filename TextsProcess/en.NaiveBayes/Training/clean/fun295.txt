Project # 87  REMOVE A TREE STUMP

    Beware the faint of heart - stump removal is an outdoor job that requires 
stamina and strength.  For $150 you can rent a stump grinder that will level a 
24-inch or smaller stump in about an hour. A tree trimming company will charge 
about $240 to do the job. You'll save almost 40% of that if you do-it-
yourself. 

    There are several types of grinders available but they all work in the 
same manner. The tree stump must be cut down to about 6-inches from the 
ground. Then you lower the machine onto the stump so the cutting blade can 
grind up the stump. The large blade has a guard over it but it still can throw 
chips.  Wear protective eye protection, gloves, work shoes and no loose 
fitting clothing. 

    A stump grinder is too large to fit into a car's trunk so plan on renting 
a trailer hitch and pulling it behind your car. Since you will have it all 
hitched up and ready to work, it's a good time to check with neighbors who 
might be willing to share the cost if they have a stump or two to grind. 
