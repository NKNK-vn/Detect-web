Real test starts here:
Telling questions:

You are hiking on a trail when you catch up to another party
travelling in the same direction but slower. Do you:
	a) Pass them without saying a word.
	b) Ask to pass.
	c) Stay behind them.
Why?  Name other conditions which may effect this answer.

You are packing with friends who are enjoying those dehydrated meals
(you know, the same ones you eat).  As you are cleaning up for the
evening, you notice your friend throw that nice little foil and
plastic pouch into the fire.  What do you do?

Would you be backpacking|climbing, etc. if the equipment weighed
twice as much?

Driving home on a steep, twisty mountain road at night.  You come
upon an accident.  The fire danger is very high.  Do you put road
flares out?

You, your spouse, and your child have an accident.  Given an
equal probability of rescue, which you can only do once,
who do you save?

You witness two people wander onto a frozen lake and fall thru.
What is the first rule of rescue?

Is the privilege of just seeing Yosemite enough?

How much would you pay for gas to visit the backcountry?

You are on Mt. Everest.  Two members of your international team
were climbing high.  A tyrolean traverse was needed to return.
The German member thought nothing of this section and started
back, but his partner, the Indian member had trouble.  The
German waited and stompped his feet until he could take it no
more.  He went back to camp and got you the assistant climbing
leader.  You rushed up high as quickly as your could with 6
other members.  You wisely grabbed a set of ski poles as wands
to find your way back.  Night is approaching and a storm is
coming.  You reach the Indian; he is badly frozen but alive.
The members decide to try to lower into a crevice to escape
the storm.  Hacking together available fixed rope, you lower
the stricten Indian, but you are 40 feet, too short.  What do
you do?

See the film Back to the Future III.  In one scene, the character
Marty gets some water.  Would you drink it?

You are faced with making a dicey rock climbing move.
Your only real hold is a locker finger jam.  If you bury your finger
in the jam and fall, you will most likely severely damage/lose the finger.
If you loosely grip the hold, you will probably fall.
How do you make the move?

A heel hook is the most secure way to make the move, but if you fall upside
down while hooking, you may get hurt.

If you try to clip a fixed piece midway through a strenuous crux,
you will probably pump out and fall, but if you don't clip it you may
take a long whipper.

If you try to make turns while skiing an icy slope, you will probably fall,
but if you don't make turns, you may develop a dangerous amount of speed.

True or false: The natural world exists and only has value in the
context of Mankind.

If you take the bivy sack to the summit, you will probably need it,
but if you don't....

You are driving to the woods.  You arrive at a broken traffic intersection
street light.  Four cars arrive simultaneously from each of the four
directions.  Who goes first?

You are offered a class on wilderness medicine on a given weekend.  You
were hoping to go backpacking that weekend.  Do you take the class or do
you go backpacking (and hope you will not need the class before you have
another chance to take it)?

Is there a situation where you would break the law to defend your family?
To defend your home?
To defend your environment?

Your new husband is from Alaska, "the frozen state," do you move up there
and join him?

Your new wife is from New York City, the concrete jungle. Do you move
there to join her?

You are snowmobiling in Yellowstone in winter.  You see a bison break thru
the ice into the frozen river.  Assume you have a rope.  Do you rescue the
bison?  A ranger comes by, what do you think the ranger would say?

Would you defend your family, even if it meant breaking the law?
Would you defend your house, when only property and not life was threatened,
even if it meant breaking the law?
Would you defend your environment, even if it meant breaking the law?

You come across a pair of turkeys busyly making sure that there will be
a new generation of turkeys.  Do you watch quietly, make some noise (so
that they know you are there) or leave (letting them have some privacy)?
What if they are human instead of feathered?
What if the story involved bears|bares instead?

If a tree falls in a forest and no human is around, does it make a sound?
If a tree falls in a forest and no human is around, does it have data?

At what age, or how do you tell, when you become too old to drive?

Rappeling has been justly flamed in many recent posts - but I have to
respond a little. Not every group of rappelers you encounter out are
necessarily rap-junkie nerds. I helped teach a vertical techniques
class to a group of cavers a couple weeks ago - and vertical techniques
for cavers means rappel and jumar practice. Your choice - you are
several hours underground, following a good breeze down a streamway, and
you come to the top of a pit of unknown depth. Typically, it is smooth
walled and overhanging. Rappel or downclimb? Remember, this is a stream
passage - whatever you do, you are going to be in the water. Ok, so you
rap the pit...on the return trip, you are now confronted by an overhanging,
smooth walled, waterfall - that happens to have a nice static rope hanging
down in it. Climb, perhaps using the rope as a top belay, or jumar?
Second scenario: El Sotano de las Golondrinas, Mexico. Here you have a 
pit some 200 feet in diameter, opening to the surface, which bells out
quickly below the lip. On the near side, the bottom is 1100 feet straight
down. The walls of the pit are pretty solid near the top, but very rotten
in several layers. Downclimb or rappel? You rap, of course, assuming you
planned ahead and brought adequate rope (we had a 1500' PMI when I was
there a few years back). You rig off a block that hangs over the edge, and
never touch the wall after the first five feet - by the time you reach the
bottom, the walls are many hundred feet distant. Ascent: climb or jumar?
Jumar, of course - but if you are going to be doing much of this kind of
thing, you are going to develop some strange systems for climbing rope.
Two jumars and a pair of etriers just don't cut it after a couple hundred
feet of free hanging rope.

Do you trench your tent?

You are skiing in mountainous backcountry with a group of five skiers.  The
trail emerges from the trees on a sidehill.  Trees are absent above and below
the trail, but reappear about 150 feet ahead.  What do you do?
Suppose you are on the return leg of a 15 mile loop.  What do you do?
Consider equipment you may have and weather conditions over the past month
when solving the problem.

You are to lead a backcountry skiing day trip.  The trip is only 6 miles
long, round trip.  The elevation is over 11,000 feet.  The sky is clear.
Two members of the group show up expecting to ski in blue jeans.  Do you
allow them to go?

Your car dies in a desert, 30 miles from the nearest town.  It is early
morning and the temperature is already over 100 degrees.  No one will miss
you for the next week (you are on vacation).  No one is likely to drive past
in the next week either.  You only have 1 quart of water.  Do you stay
with the car or start walking to town?  Do you drink the the water as
you feel you are thirsty or do you try to ration it?


You tend to participate in activities above your skill level, i.e.
ski black slopes as an intermediate skier, do not attend classes,
or use gear designed for teh activity (i.e. backpacking w/ only an
old sleeping bag, a zippo lighter, a bag of tortilla chips and
a Sunday paper).
Is ths acceptable behaviour?  Does the 'go with the flow' attitude
enhance or detract from the experience?  Does the 'well, I won't hurt
abyone else if I screw up' attitude remove moral culpability?


Five guys are crossing a glacier near the Chinese border, a kind of neutral
strip. They spent 2 months for getting a permit to there - they had to
convince the Border Guard. Suddenly a military helicopter drops them a
capsule. Inside is an order to come back. Should they go back =?

A band of four is swiftly skiing across a treeless rugged backountry towards
the ridges of Ural. They do it for 4 days, crossing numerous passages. All of a
sudden, one of them tells to their leader that he has a stomach ulcer and
it just turned worse. =?

You just went to sleep at your tent in a nice valley of Caucasus. Suddenly
a ranger wakes you up asking for help and good anesthetics: somebody up
there fell and has a vertebrae problem. Surprisingly you have what they
haven't. A night ascent -> that lady with crushed vertebrae is not to be
brutally transported -> there's a chance to get a copter, but no
walkie-talkie. These poor rangers have a car radio below in the valley.
You spend the rest of the night to get there. There really is one ranger
in the car, and he's absolutely drunk, barely able to say something.
he says: tha-yk! you guys yek! would you -wmmm? drink too - =?
 
You got a ticket to a plane that flies from the city of Norilsk to a frozen
lake at Putorana Mountains, some 300 miles ahead. The plane appears to be
out of order, so you are told to be ready to use the next flight - which is
2 weeks later. Meanwhile, your permit is issued by the Border Guard and
expires a month later. It's possible to get to mountains by ski - their
foothills are just in 140 miles from you. =?

You just broke/lost your compass in the middle of an eight hour (or
eight day) hike and you are in a maze of twisty little valleys very
similar.  How can you find your way out?  (assume going down stream
will not get you to civilianization in a reasonable time.)

Before you are the disassembled parts of a high powered hunting
rifle and the assembly directions written in Swahili, in five
minutes an angry rhino will charge into your room.  Solve this problem.

YOU ARE IN A MAZE WITH TWISTY PASSAGES ALL ALIKE.

What is the role of forgetting to an AI system?

Can you prove your educational flexibility?

You are in the desert, at your feet is a tortoise.  The tortoise
is laying on his back in the hot desert sun.....

Good questions always sought.

If you think the out of doors is a social process or a social club,
that the forest is like Bambi, or Rambo, or the movies,
you are mistaken.  This is how track skiers and sport climbers get
into trouble in increasing numbers.  Get out while you can.
