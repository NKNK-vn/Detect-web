Ye Children All of Mother Earth
(It came upon a midnight clear...)

Ye children all of Mother Earth
join hands and circle around
To celebrate the Solstice night
When our lost Lord is found.
   Rejoice, the year has begun again
   The Sun blesses skies up above
   So share the season together now
   In everlasting Love!

=======================================
Gloria

Snow lies deep upon the Earth
Still our voices warmly sing
Heralding the glorious birth
Of the Child, the Winter King
   Glo -- ria!
   In excelsis Deo!
   Glo -- ria!
   In excelsis Dea!

Our triumphant voices claim
Joy and hope and love renewed
And our Lady's glad refrain
Answer Winter's solitude
   Glo -- ria!(etc.)

In Her arms a holy Child
Promises a glowing Light
Through the winter wind so wild
He proclaims the growing Light.
   Glo -- ria! (etc..)

Now the turning of the year
Of the greater Turning sings
Passing age of cold and fear
Soon our golden summer brings.
   Glo -- ria! (etc..)
