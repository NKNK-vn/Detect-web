							September 1, 1987



Despite extensive interest about the formation of the American broadcasting
service and its pioneering members, there has been a dearth of information
about a number of fundamental topics.  This is designed as an overview and
reference source for some of the neglected areas, spotlighting the period
through May of 1922.

FORMATION OF THE BROADCASTING SERVICE

The formal inauguration of the broadcasting service took place in September of
1921 (1), with the assignment of two wavelengths:  360 meters (833 kiloHertz)
for entertainment, defined as "news, concerts, lectures, and such matter", and
485 meters (618 kiloHertz) for "crop reports and weather forecasts".  The use
of two different wavelengths reflected the department practice of segregating
different activities on different wavelengths.	Individual station
authorizations were issued for either or both of the wavelengths, depending on
the service the station provided.  Although broadcasting activities had been
evolving for more than a decade, this allocation was the first to designate
stations stations specifically licensed for, and restricted to, public
broadcasting, using wavelengths exclusively set aside for the broadcasting
service.

The choice of these two wavelengths was apparently ratification of previous
practice.  Two stations, operated by the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company, already held licenses authorizing radiophone operation
on 360 meters:	KDKA, East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which received its initial
license October 27, 1920 and began daily transmissions with election returns on
November 2, 1920, and WJZ, Newark, New Jersey, which received its initial
authorization in May of 1921, but did not begin regular broadcasts until the
first of October.  (3) Westinghouse officials had specifically requested the
use of 360 meters to avoid interference from other services, (4) and the
wavelength apparently had never been previously used.  (5)

The status of the other broadcasting wavelength, 485 meters, prior to its
assignment to the broadcasting service, is less clear.	However, an
experimental station, 5XD, operated by the New Mexico State College in State
College, New Mexico, is reported to have used it for transmitting telegraphic
"time signals, weather reports, and news items", and then, beginning in early
1920, for voice transmissions including music and educational talks.  (6)

LICENSING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

At the time of the creation of the broadcasting service, licensing was
conducted under the provisions of the Radio Act of 1912.  Although the standard
since the 1927 formation of the Federal Radio Commission has been that stations
serve the "public convenience, interest, or necessity", (7), no comparable
guideline was mandated by the 1912 act, and licensing of the pioneer broadcast
service stations amounted to little more than registration.  Licensing
authority at the time of the creation of the broadcasting service was vested in
the Secretary of Commerce, and exercised through the Bureau of Navigation.
This body operated on a much more informal basis than successor regulators.
Moreover, control was much more decentralized, with oversight, performed
primarily by regional Radio Inspectors, generally limited to insuring that
stations met technical standards.  (8)

The standard procedure for procuring a broadcast license in the early twenties
was as follows:  the prospective station operator filled out an "Applicant's
Description of Apparatus" (Form 761), obtained from the region's Radio
Inspector.(9) The completed form, which provided mostly technical information,
was submitted to the inspector, who, if deemed necessary, inspected the
proposed apparatus.  Next the form, including the inspection report plus a
recommendation on the type of authorization to be issused, was forwarded to the
Commissioner of Navigation in Washington, D.C.	(10)

Here two distinct steps were taken:  first call letters were assigned to the
application, then, if everything was in order, a formal operating authorization
was issued.  The period between the assignment of call letters and formal
authorization ranged from immediate action to as much as forty days, and
according to Commerce records was usually in the range of one to three days.

The assignment of a call sign, usually recorded in the files as taking place
when the Form 761 was received, was not considered as establishing a station.
New stations were not reported in the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN until the first
operating authorization--usually a license but in a few cases a preliminary
telephoned or telegraphed authorization--was issued.  (11)

License periods for broadcasting stations ranged from as few as ten days (12)
to one year, with one year licenses the norm for grants made until early
January, 1922, six months the standard during mid-January, 1922, and three
months the norm thereafter.  License renewal was obtained via the submission of
an updated Form 761 at the required intervals.

The above covers the standard and normally used procedures, although Commerce
files report the process was speeded in a few special cases by direct letters,
telegrams, and telephone conversations between applicants and Washington
officials.

STATION DELETIONS

Station deletions in the early twenties were performed with even less formality
and consistency than licensing.  When a station discontinued broadcasting
before the end of a license period, the station operator could return the
license for cancellation.  However, it appears that in most cases the station
owners didn't bother--instead they just let the licenses expire in due course.
Moreover, the lapse of a station license was seen as no more the the close of
an operating authorization, and rarely resulted in immediate deletion from the
official station lists.  Generally a grace period was allowed, on the
assumption that many would eventually received another license.

The timespan between the expiration of a license and formal deletion varied
greatly, and according to Commerce files most stations were not removed from
the published lists until one to six months after their operating licenses had
lapsed.  The whole process has a distinct "we'll delete them when we get around
to it" feel, and appears to have been to some degree dependent on the diligence
of the district Radio Inspectors.(13) Because of the flexible deletion
practices, the number of stations deleted in a given month is by no means a
precise barometer of the decline in activity for that month, as the licenses
for many of these stations had in fact expired a number of weeks or months
previously.  Likewise, official lists of this period invariably include
stations no longer holding active licenses, and merely awaiting formal removal.

TEMPORARY STATIONS

One category of broadcasting stations has been almost completely
undocumented--that of temporary grants.  These were issued for special
occasions, usually lasting a month or less, and were not reported in the RADIO
SERVICE BULLETIN.  There is very little detailed information about these grants
recorded in the Commerce files, although at least seventy were issued in the
period from January, 1922 to October, 1928.  For temporary grants made through
May, 1922, where wavelength information is recorded, the wavelength assigned
was always 360 meters.(14) Detailed histories for five temporary stations
operated by educational organizations can be found in EDUCATION'S OWN
STATIONS.(15)

Listed below are the fifteen stations listed in Commerce files as receiving
temporary grants for the period through the end of May, 1922.  Commerce records
for these stations are minimal, and as there is apparent source of additional
information, save for those stations documented in EDUCATION'S OWN STATIONS,
there can be no guarantee of completeness.

CALL LETTER POLICIES

One area which has been particularly murky is that of call letter policies.
Following the adoption of the "Radio Act of 1912", call signs for most
non-amateur services were composed of three letters.(16) Because most early
commercial land stations were clustered along the coast, the original policy
for land stations was that those on the Pacific coast were normally assigned
calls starting with K, while calls starting with W were normally assigned to
outlets along the Great Lakes and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.(17)

With the development of inland services, further refinements were required.  As
land stations, broadcasters have generally followed the "K's in the West, W's
in the East" standard.  However, two different East-West dividing lines have
been used.  Originally the boundary ran along the eastern borders of Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.  It was only in late January, 1923 that the
line was shifted to the current standard of the Mississippi River.

The rapid expansion of the ship service during World War One required
utilization of four-letter calls for ship stations, including, in alphabetical
order, calls from the KE--, KI--, KO--, KU--, and, starting June, 1920, KD--
blocks.  (Land stations continued to generally receive three-letter calls.) The
assignment of the conspicuous call KDKA to the pioneer East Pittsburgh
broadcaster has been viewed as evidence of some sort of special status.
However, review of the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN shows what actually occurred was
more mundane.  For some reason, during the period of June, 1920 through April,
1921 most commercial land stations received calls from the four letter ship
blocks, and by nothing more significant than coincidence KDKA was the only
broadcaster to be born in this period.(18)

The policy of three-letter calls for land stations was restored after this
lapse, until the flood of broadcasting grants required that the broadcasting
service switch to four-letter calls, with Western broadcasting stations sharing
the KD--, and later KF-- and KG-- blocks with ship stations, while Eastern
broadcasters were assigned calls from the W-A-, and later W-B-, blocks.  Some
stations received calls outside these blocks due to special requests, and
eventually individual call requests became the norm.

Call letter "combinations which, for various reasons, international, national,
local, or individual may be objectionable" (19) were avoided.  Accordingly, in
this period it was apparently decided that "WDAM" might be considered
objectionable, as Commerce records show that the assignment of this particular
call to a Western Electric Company station in New York City was changed after
ten days, with the call WEAF substituted.  (This station is now WNBC.)

CRITIQUE OF PERIOD SOURCES

While preparing the chronological list of station activity some idiosyncracies
of three traditional sources of licensing information became apparent.	The
best generally available source of information for the early twenties is the
RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN, issued by the Bureau of Navigation, which reported
monthly the changes, deletions, and new station grants made during the
preceding month.  Three important characteristics of the Bulletin have
sometimes been overlooked.  The first is that its station lists do not report
chronologically the grants within a given month, as the Bulletin lists always
used non-chronological formats, such as alphabetically by city of license or
call sign.  Second, a few stations entered the broadcasting service
classification by metamorphosis from another service category, so their debuts
are recorded in the "alterations and corrections" lists, rather than the new
station lists which herald the appearance of more conventional entrants to the
service.  This alternate route was used by three stations in the period through
May, 1922:  KQV, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; KDPT, San Diego, California; and
WRR, Dallas, Texas.  Third, broadcasting station additions, changes, and
deletions were not reported in a separate category until the July 1, 1922
issue.	Prior to this date they were intermixed with the other classes of
"commercial land stations", so care must be taken in extracting broadcast
service information.

The Bulletin was not completely free from occasional typographical errors--for
example, in the January 2, 1922 issue both KJB, Everett, Washington and KFL,
Seattle, Washington are incorrectly listed as being broadcast grants, and one
station, WGI (later WARC), Medford Hillside, Massachusetts, seems to have
disappeared without benefit of official notification.  However, overall there
were only a few minor discrepancies betweeen information contained in the
Bulletin, and that found in government records.

Another source of licensing information proved somewhat more suspect.  W.  E.
Downey, Supervisor of Radio at the Department of Commerce, appears to have
regularly provided monthly totals of broadcasting station additions, deletions,
and outstanding authorizations.(20) As seen in the listing below there are a
number of discrepancies, for the period through May, 1922, between the monthly
figures reported by Downey, and the information contained in Commerce records
and the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN.(21)

The most troubling feature about the Downey figures is the complete absence of
deletions.  In fact, Downey reports no deletions until September of 1922.
However, review of the Commerce records and the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN clearly
shows that fifteen stations were deleted prior to September, beginning with two
in March.  Since the Downey figures do not list specific stations, the cause of
the differences is not readily apparent.

Finally, the new station totals appearing in Gleason Archer's HISTORY OF RADIO
TO 1926 (22) have a readily identifiable flaw.	Archer's figures are inflated,
because they are actually the number of new "commercial land stations" reported
monthly by the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN.	As noted earlier, this means the
figures erroneously include many non-broadcast service grants, and also omit a
few transfers to the broadcast service that were reported in the change lists.

BROADCAST SERVICE ACTIVITY LIST

Presented at the close is a chronological list of broadcasting service activity
for all non-temporary stations from October, 1920 to the close of May, 1922.

Most of the actions are new station grants.  The information for new grants is
organized according to the headers appearing at the top of each page.  The
additions are listed by their initial broadcasting service authorization
date--normally the date of the first broadcast service license.  "LIC" refers
to the standard case where the first broadcast authorization was the licensing
of a new station.  "TRN" denotes stations whose first broadcast license was a
transfer from a non-broadcast service classification, using the same call sign.
"REL" refers to the relicensing of a previously deleted broadcast station.  In
a few cases an authorization to broadcast was made before the first license was
issued.  Initial authorizations by telephone and telegraph are denoted "TP" and
"TG" respectively.  "STA" stands for a "Special Temporary Authorization", while
"AUT" appears for one station where the records merely list it as "authorized".

Included with the initial authorization date is the call sign, city of license,
and station owner, plus frequency assigned.  "E" stands for the entertainment
wavelength of 360 meters (833 KiloHertz), and "M" denotes the market and
weather wavelength of 485 meters (618 kiloHertz).

The next column covers the call letter assignment information, which as noted
earlier was a part of the application process, and took place prior to the
issuance of an operating authorization.  The three entries here are the date of
the call assignment, the form of the request, and the origin of the request.
In most cases the standard procedure was followed, with the application process
begun with the receipt of a Form 761 from a regional Radio Inspector.  The nine
radio inspection districts were headquartered in the following locations:

	    1. Boston, Massachusetts	6. San Francisco, California
	    2. New York, New York	7. Seattle, Washington
	    3. Baltimore, Maryland	8. Detroit, Michigan
	    4. Savannah, Georgia	9. Chicago, Illinois
	    5. New Orleans, Louisiana

In addition, a few of the Form 761s came via Norfolk, Virginia.

Most exceptions to the standard procedure occurred when the station owners
("OWN") dealt directly with Washington, via telephone ("TP"), telegraph ("TG"),
letter ("LET"), or call letter reservation ("RES").  In one case W.  E.  Downey
("WED") was listed as the person involved in making the call assignment.

The next column notes the date of the first broadcast service license and the
duration of that initial license.  The final "status" column lists the eventual
fate of the station--either its deletion date (with call sign if different from
the original) or status as of September 1, 1987.

When only the month of an action is known, usually reflecting data derived from
the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN, two dashes appear for the day the action took
place.	A "(?)" marks a "best guess" required because of incomplete or
ambigious information, which in most cases should not be more than a few days
off.  As might be expected, some errors, both in the original records and
during the research process, must be assumed to have crept in.	However,
extensive cross-referencing of original records and other source material
should insure that errors have been minimalized.  Moreover, it is certain that
these 319 grants comprise the complete roster of non-temporary broadcasting
authorizations issued during this period.

The one entry which must be viewed with due caution is that of current status.
Unlike human beings, which have clearly defined births, lives, and deaths,
these stations sometimes had very complicated histories, complete with
resurrections, call sign and ownership changes, consolidations of two or more
stations under a single call, and facility exchanges.  Review of the station
histories in EDUCATION'S OWN STATIONS will give a good idea of the tumultuous
histories some of these stations enjoyed.  This caveat nowithstanding, the
status information was included to provide a feel for the outcome of these
stations as a class, even though a few station histories are really too tangled
to allow refinement to a single entry.	One general standard for status column
entries was that, in case of doubt, the nod was given to interpretations which
provide continuity and longevity.  In particular, stations which were deleted
but then immediately relicensed were treated as having a single unbroken
lifespan, so deletion dates are those where the final unreversed deletion took
place, and stations still active might have been deleted and relicensed
somewhere along the way.

SUMMARY

The information presented will hopefully provide a more complete understanding
of the policies of the period, and permit more detailed analysis of the
development of the broadcast service.  For instance, the chronological list of
new broadcast station grants clearly shows the abrupt shift from the slow
initial expansion of the service though November of 1921, with the grand total
of nine grants dominated by notheastern and midwestern radio equipment firms,
to the popular expansion that began in December of 1921, when owners of all
kinds sponsored stations.  In fact, this popularization has every appearance of
a rapidly spreading West Coast fad, as fully sixteen of the twenty-two grants
made from December, 1921 to January 4, 1922 were for West Coast facilities.

NOTES ON SOURCES

The original card files for broadcasting stations, maintained by the Commerce
Department, comprised the basic source of station information through the
period up to the March, 1927 assumption of regulatory authority by the Federal
Radio Commission.  [NOTE:  A major componant of the Commerce files used for
this research no longer exists.  The nature of the Ownership card files, which
held licensee and license date data, was apparantly misunderstood, and
according to FCC employee Mary McDonald these files were declared in August,
1987 to be "no longer needed" and destroyed].  Information from that point
forward is included in the Federal Communications Commission station card
files.	Both sets of cards are currently available through the Mass Media
Bureau of the Federal Communica- tions Commission, and as of September, 1987
obtainable from the Public Reference Room located on the second floor of 1919 M
Street, Northwest, Washington, D.  C.

Information from the basic resources was double-checked against a number of
sources, the most important being the grant, deletion, and cumulative station
lists appearing in the RADIO SERVICE BULLETIN, the original station licenses
and 761 Forms archived at the Washington National Records Center in Suitland,
Maryland, and an undated "List of First Stations Licensed for Broadcasting"
(through March, 1922, with a few omissions), which was prepared by FCC
personnel, but had no additional identification, and was obtained through the
Broadcast Pioneers Library in Washington, D.  C.
