
I once came upon a tree.  Not a very grand tree, but a tree all
  the same.  I said to myself, now that is a tree.  I looked up, pondering this
tree that had so caught my eye, and I said to myself, this tree was made for
climbing.  Without thinking, I hastily caught the first limb and hoisted myself
up.  Standing there and looking down, I felt good.  But when I looked up to
search for my next move, I was amazed at this tree's vast maze of branches.
They extended forever, it seemed, in all directions.  I started my journey,
picking the path that would lead me to the top.  With each decision, I chose the
way that would let me reach the pinacle.  And as I quested fiercely for this
goal, I began to notice other parts of the tree, maybe not as high as my goal,
but just as pretty, and sometimes more peaceful and I came to realize that the
furthur I climbed, my choices became less and less, and in the end, I would have
no choices at all, but to climb where I must climb.  On I went.
