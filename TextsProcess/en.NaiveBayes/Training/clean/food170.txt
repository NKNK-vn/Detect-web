Cut beef into 1/2-inch strips; put in a plastic bag with 3 tablespoons of flour
and the salt.  Shake until the meat is evenly coated.

In a heavy skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil/shortening, add the meat strips and
brown slowly, stirring often.  Add onion, garlic, Coca-Cola, and 1/4 cup of
water; mix well.  Cover and simmer 30 to 45 minutes or until the meat is
fork-tender.

In a bowl, mix the 2 tablespoons of flour with the 1/2 cup of water until
smooth.  Stir into the meat along with the Worcestershire sauce and the
undrained mushrooms.  Stir and cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. (If making
ahead for reheating later, do not add the sour cream now.  Reheat, then complete
the recipe directions.)

Stir in the sour cream and heat gently just until the gravy simmers.  Sprinkle
with parsley and serve over potatoes, noodles, or rice.  Makes 6 servings or 3
cups.
