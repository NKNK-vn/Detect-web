In a large heavy duty casserole or Dutch oven (about 5 qt.) warm the

grated potato.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cook
partially covered, for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Cut the Poblano into 1/2" strips.  Add them to the chili and cook ,
stirring often, for another 30 to 45 minutes or until the pork is
tender and the chili is thickened to your liking.  Taste for correct
seasonings and let cook another 5 minutes.  Serve hot.

NOTE: To roast Poblanos, stick them on a serving fork and turn over a
gas burner until thoroughly charred.  Wrap chilies in a paper bag
after you roast them.  When cool, rinse under cold running water,
rubbing off the burned skin.  Pat dry and de-stem chilies.
