Ingredients:
12 slices bread (I prefer     4 T butter or margarine.
something hearty, like whole-
wheat, but use white if you
must, crusts are optional)
3/4 tsp. cinnamon             3 c. milk
1/3 c sugar                   1-1/2 tsp. vanilla
1/4 tsp. salt (opt.)          4 eggs
1/4-1/2 c. raisins,           whipped cream (opt.)
nutmeats, other dried fruits
(opt.)

Instructions:
 Butter bread on one side, slice into fingers and again into
cubes.  Place in greased baking dish, layer with fruits and
nuts if desired. sprinkle layers with cinnamon. (I usually
make 3 or 4 layers)  Beat together milk, sugar, vanilla,
salt and eggs, until well mixed.  Pour over bread layers.
Bake at 325 for 50-55 min. (cold knife inserted into center
will come out clean)  Serve warm or cold, garnish with
whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.  I love this with
fruit, and sometimes I add 1/4c of rum or brandy in place of
part of the milk.  I also prefer it very firm, and may use
up to twice as much bread as the recipe calls for, but you
will have to experiment for yourself.
