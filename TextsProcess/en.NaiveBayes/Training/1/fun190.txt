        - A word about user supported software: -

        The user supported software concept (usually referred to as
        shareware) is an attempt to provide software at low cost.  The
        cost of offering a new product by conventional means is
        staggering, and hence dissuades many independent authors and
        small companies from developing and promoting their ideas.  User
        supported software is an attempt to develop a new marketing
        channel, where products can be introduced at low cost.

        If user supported software works, then everyone will benefit.
        The user will benefit by receiving quality products at low cost,
        and by being able to "test drive" software thoroughly before
        purchasing it.  The author benefits by being able to enter the
        commercial software arena without first needing large sources of
        venture capital.

        But it can only work with your support.  We're not just talking
        about THE LOVE BASE here, but about all user supported software.
        If you find that you are still using a program after a couple of
        weeks, then pretty obviously it is worth something to you, and
        you should send in a contribution.

                            - USING THE LOVE BASE -



        Just type LOVEBASE from the DOS prompt and press the return key
        to run the program.


        All function keys are displayed on the screen.

        Select section from the menu.  Bring the menu up at any time by
        pressing the letter "M".

        Find text by pressing "F".  Use this to search for an author's
        name or for keywords.  A global search will search from the very
        first entry through to the very last.  A local search is
        considerably faster but searches only the section you are
        currently viewing.

        Repeat the last find operation by pressing "R".

        Print the currently displayed entry by pressing the letter "P".

        Send the currently displayed entry to a text file on disk by
        pressing "T".

        "G"o to entry number.  Goes immediately to the entry number
        specified.

        Up and down arrow keys move through the entries one at a time.

        Pressing the spacebar moves forward through the entries one at
        a time.

        Home and end keys move to the first and last entries
        respectively.

                       - THE PURPOSE OF THE LOVE BASE -


            We live in an age devoid of ideals, devoid of dreams, devoid
        of hope.  The dollar is our God, television our mentor, the
        newspaper our Bible.  Drugs and sex make our heaven.  Nobody
        even thinks of perfection as we strive headlong for mediocrity
        with workman-like efficiency.

            We are dying.

            The ideal of perfect romantic love is far from being the
        loftiest of ideals.  It hardly compares with the ideals of
        knowledge and wisdom.  But the romantic ideal is far superior to
        the so-called ideals of material wealth and power.

            An ideal is the most wonderful disease, for it makes one
        totally dissatisfied with life.  Only then can one look higher,
        higher, and maybe . . . begin . . . to think.

        Other shareware programs by the same author:


        BREEZE:     Word processor/text editor, many features.  Can turn
                    your ordinary text files into stand-alone executable
                    programs (with viewing & searching features) for you
                    to distribute.  Analyze readability, check spelling,
                    statistical analysis, sorting, indexing, multiple
                    files/windows.  Very easy to learn and use.

        TEXTLIFE:   Text file to .EXE program converter.

        CONTROL3:   File manager, lists three drives/directories on screen
                    simultaneously.

        LIFEGAME:   Graphical simulation of natural systems.

        DI:         Directory program for moving quickly around your
                    hard disk.

        PCONTROL:   Printer controller program.

        POWER WORDS:  5000 quotes at your fingertips - fast!  All packed
                    into a single executable program.





        And four computer books:

        POISON FOR THE HEART:   The ultimate philosophy.

        Written in an aphoristic style for those who don't like to waste
        their time with padding.  Discusses the law of cause and effect
        and its far reaching ramifications.  Investigates the nature of
        the ego, attachment, religion, men and women.  Arguably the only
        book a thinking person needs to read.


        WIT FOR WISDOM:   Compact truth.

        "Wit for Wisdom" is a compilation of the most incisive gems of
        wit, along with a few drops of my own blood.  Unlike normal
        collections of quotes, aphorisms and apothegms, this work has
        both a purpose and a message.  So this is not so much a book for
        wits, but for thinkers.  Wit for wisdom is a kind of wit that is
        too witty even for wits.  Of all the areas of interest covered
        in this work, the subjects of the sexes and the relationships
        between them predominate, they being responsible for the larger
        part of our foolishness.  The viewing program allows you to send
        the text to your printer or to a text file on disk.


        VENOM CRYSTALS:

        A compilation of the most powerful spiritual/philosophic
        writings of all time.  Includes the best from Buddhism,
        Christianity, Hinduism, Taoism, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche.


        LETTERS BETWEEN ENEMIES:

        Amazing correspondence between two thinkers.  Explores the life
        experiences and philosophies of two friends on the path to
        Knowledge.

                               "Love hurts"

                          by John E. Pickersgill
                                Tasmania


                     I knew a man called Tom McPherson.
                     He was a very clumsy person.
                     Two left arms and two left feet,
                     The clumsiest man you'd ever meet.

                     Each step he took he fell down twice.
                     He tripped and stumbled all through life.
                     Accidents that couldn't happen
                     Were Tom McPherson's daily pattern.

                     Now you may doubt and you may scoff,
                     But he's fell in and he's fell off,
                     Everything you'd care to mention,
                     Although, it's not been his intention.

                     One day in Spring he fell again,
                     In love this time with clumsy Gwen.
                     Her two left feet and two left arms,
                     He thought her most appealing charms.

                     Of course you'd have no doubt at all
                     That they were married in the fall,
                     And at the altar said "I do",
                     While falling down a time or two.

                     A honeymoon of carefree bliss,
                     They fell off that, they fell off this,
                     But they fell more in love than ever,
                     Having accidents together.

                     Weeks of love, of joy and rapture,
                     Of bruises, cuts, sometimes a fracture,
                     Sweet memories shared of true romance
                     Travelling home by ambulance.

                     But now here comes the tragic part,
                     A bit to wring the hardest heart.
                     They both were fell on by a horse,
                     It was an accident - of course.

                     Life's ups and downs are unremitting,
                     Their end was sad but strangely fitting.
                     An ending flat, yet nice and neat,
                     The horse you see, had four left feet.
