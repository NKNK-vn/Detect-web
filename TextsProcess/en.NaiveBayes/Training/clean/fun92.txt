Decoding the Social Security Number
(from "Social-Security-Numbers And Other Telling Information:" 
by Simson Garfinkel, published in the Whole Earth Review, Fall 1989)
 
The first three digits of a person's Social Security Number indicate
the state that the person was living in at the time the number was
assigned (see table).  The exceptions to this rule are numbers in the 
700-729 range, which were issued by the Railroad Retirement agency, the 
only such retirement plan to have its own block of SSNs.
 
The fourth and fifth digits indicate the group number.  The sequence is
reported to be odd numbers from 01-09, then even numbers from 10-98, then
even numbers 02-08, and finally odd numbers 11-99.  All numbers issued
before 1965 are either odd numbers between 01 and 09, or even numbers 
between 10 and 98.  The last four digits are the "serial number," and run
from 0001 to 9999...
