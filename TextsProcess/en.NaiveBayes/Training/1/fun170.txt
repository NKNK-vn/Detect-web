INSOMNIA PROBLEM?:

Beside Camomile at night you can take before going to sleep an
infusion of #tilleul or fleur d'oranger# or #aubepine# which all
have a definite soothing action. The following recipe is said to
resolve the worst case of insomnia.

I should try it, since I write all the time at night but then
again I am a night bird like all barmen we are the owls of life.
Now back to the grinder with this recipe; sleep on it.

In one litre of water let infuse 1/4 of a tbsp of petal de
#coquelicot# with 10 grams of lettuce leaves and a pinch of
#aubepine# flower and a pinch of #metilot#. No you don't have to
drink the whole litre of water because you would be up all night
running to the bathroom.
