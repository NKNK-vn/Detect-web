         holes, folds, or tears.  Eight and one half inches on one set
         of sides by eleven inches on the other are recommended
         dimensions of the sheet of paper, but other sizes may be
         used.
              2) Imagine a line with endpoints at the bisection of the
         shorter sides, and fold the paper in half at this line.
         Crease the fold and then open the paper so that it rests upon
         the fold, and the halves of the paper point upward in a `V'
         shape.  Designate one of the short ends as forward and the
         other as rear.
              3) Fold the right forward corner to the crease so that
         an isoscoles triangle is formed.  The equal sides should be
         each one half the width of the paper, one running from the
         forward end of the crease until the right angle of the
         corner, which should also lay on the crease.  The other equal
         side should run from the corner to the right edge of the
         paper, and should be perpendicular to the crease.
              4) Repeat step 3 on the left side as if it were the
         mirror image of the right.  You should now have a five sided
         shape resembling a triangle sitting on top of a rectangle.
              5) Starting with the first point at forward, mentally
         designate each corner with a letter going clockwise A, B, C,
         D and E.  Fold corner B down to the crease so that side AB
         follows the crease.  Then fold corner E to the crease so that
         side EA is on the crease.
              6) Fold the main crease back up so that the two sides
         match and cover each other.  Make a fold on each side
         parallel to the crease and approximately one-fourth to one-
         third of the width from the crease to the side.  These folds
         should point away from each other and should form a flat
         surface perpendicular to the main body.
              Optional: the following are steps that can be taken to
         `jazz up' your paper airplane, but are not essential to basic
         flight.
              7) To give a longer, smoother flight, place a paper clip
         one or two inches from the forward tip.  The clip should be
         placed over the crease.
              8) For a more predictable and stable flight, place a
         short piece of scotch tape from one wing to the other. The
         tape should not exceed one and one half inches in length and
         should be placed approximately one third of the way from the
         rear to the front.
              9) To make a tail, cut or carefully tear at the rear of
         the plane (one to two inches from the rear) starting from the
         crease straight to the wings being careful not to cut or tear
         the wings.  Push the rear section that you have just
         separated up with your fingers until the section from the cut
         back sticks up from the wings in the opposing direction from
         the body.
              Other tips can be found in the Advanced How to Make a
         Paper Airplane by the author.
