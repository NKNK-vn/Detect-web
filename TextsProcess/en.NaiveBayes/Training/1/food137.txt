Well, several people asked for this list of recipes so here it is.  Now you'll
know what to do next time you happen upon a herd of cows in a meadow at 10,000 
ft :-).  Having started a batch last night, I have a suggestion of my own to 
add: if this is your first batch, make sure you have some store-bought
jerky on hand for the inevitable feeding frenzy resulting from the aroma 
given off by the dehydrator.  If you're on a diet, you might consider going
elsewhere while it's running because I think I put on 10 lbs just from 
breathing the air :-).   For those who wanted to know, my dehydrator is
the el-cheapo K-TEL model.  I expect they're all pretty much the same since
the principle involved is very simple, but I won't be surprised when the
marketing people develop a 16-valve double overhead cam turbocharged model.

And thanks once again to those who sent in their recipes.

We've made Jerky for years from beef and venison, and I believe
this will work for almost any kind of meat.

We cut the meat into thin strips, the thinner the strips the
crunchier the jerky comes out, maybe 1/4 " thick will make chewy
jerky.  By the way, cut all the fat off the meat as you're
stripping.

Lay out the strips on a cookie sheet lined with foil, turned up
at the edges so juice won't get over everything.  Lay out in
rows and a single layer.  Sprinkle liberally with black coarse
ground pepper and seasoned salt, or spices that you like the
taste of.

Set the oven to WARM, and leave in the oven overnite, or 8-10
hrs. This causes very slow drying.  Store in a plastic
container, jar, or can after well cooled.  Too much moisture
left in the meat will cause mold, and putting it away while warm
will cause sweating inside the container.

  1/2   cup  dark soy sauce
  2     Tbs  Worcestershire sauce
  1     tsp  monosodium glutamate (optional)
  1/2   tsp  onion powder
  1/2   tsp  garlic powder
  1/4   tsp  powdered ginger
  1/4   tsp  Chinese Five-Spice Powder
  3     lbs  lean beef brisket, eye-of-round or flank steak,
             trimmed completely of fat and cut across grain into
             slices 1/8 inch thick*

Blend all ingredients except meat in small bowl.  Dip each piece
of meat into marinade, coating well.  Place in shallow dish.
Pour remaining marinade over top, cover and refrigerate
overnight.

Oven method:  Preheat oven to lowest setting (preferably 110 F).
 Place several layers of paper towels on baking sheets.  Arrange
meat in single layer on prepared sheets and cover with
additional toweling.  Flatten meat with rolling pin.  Discard
towels and set meat directly on oven racks.  Let dry 8 to 12
hours (depending on temperature of oven).

Dehydrator method:  Arrange meat on trays in single layer and
dehydrate 10 to 12 hours, depending on thickness.

Store jerky in plastic bags or in tightly covered containers in
cool, dry area.

*To aid in slicing meat thinly, freeze until ice crystals are
formed.

paper thin strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide and 4 inches long.
Transfer to shallow pan. Combine marinade ingredients and rub
thoroughly into meat.  Arrange meat on racks and let dry at cool
room temperature overnight (do not refrigerate).

Preheat oven to 250 F. Line two large baking sheets with foil
and set wire racks on top of each baking sheet. Arrange meat on
racks in single layer. Bake 30 minutes.

Reduce heat to 175 F and continue drying meat another 40
minutes.  Meat should be lightly brown but not burnt. Let meat
continue to dry on racks at cool room temperature overnight
before packing into jars.

Dried meat can be brushed lightly with sesame oil for additional
flavor and shine. Makes about 36 pieces.

SEVEN STEP JERKY

Basic ingredients are: garlic powder, onion powder, onion powder, black
pepper, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, Accent.  Also
knife and pan or bowl.

Slice three pounds of venison into strips about 3/8 inch thick to ensure
total saturation of the meat while it's marinating.  In container, combine
1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup Worchestershire, 2 tsp. Accent, 2 tsp. seasoned
salt, 2/3 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. onion powder, adn 2/3 tsp. black
pepper.

Stir this mixture well with a spoon to dissolve all of the soluble
ingredients.  Now the marinaade is ready to be used.

Place the strips of meat in the marinade be sure they're completely
submerged.  Marinate overnight, turning if necessary.

Lay marinated meat strips on oven rack.  Cook for 6 to 8 (6 is better) at
150 degrees.  They get crisper the longer they bake.

Store finished jerky in zip-lock bags or other airtight containers to seal
in freshness.  Jerky will keep up to two years.



A good book on making beef jerky and other light-weight foods is:

    THE HUNGRY HIKERS BOOK OF GOOD COOKING
      by GRETCHEN McHUGH
       published by Alfred Knopf 1989
       ISBN 0-394-51261-8


just to give you the section on jerky, in case you don't find it,
quoting directly from the book::


   to make jerky, take a raw piece of beef round or chuck, quite lean
and slice it thin, across the grain.  Lay the slices across the racks
of the dryer for two days and nights -- test it by breaking a piece,
it is dry enough when it cracks in two when you break it. The smaller
and thinner you cut the pieces of meat before drying them, the quicker
they will get tender as you soak and cook them

(remember, its easier to slice thinly if the steak is partially frozen)
    One pound of sliced beef dries to 4 ounces of jerky, making
    a ratio of undried to dried meat of about 4:1.

Before drying the meat, you can season it with some combination of the
following spices: paprika, pepper, salt, or other concoctions like
lemon pepper or seasoned salt.  Garlic is wonderful on jerky.  I recommend
rubbing the meat with cut cloves of garlic before slicing it.

A marinade will change the taste slightly, and cause the meat to take longer
to dry.  Marinating tenderizes the meat however, acid in soy sauce and
wine, breaks down the tissues of the meat.


      SIMPLE MARINADE FOR BEEF JERKY


for 3lbs of lean beef:

   2 tablespoons soy sauce
   1/4 teaspoon salt
   2 drops of tabasco, or cayenne
    pepper to taste,
   ground pepper
    1 fresh garlic clove, minced

  slice the beef as thin as you can across the grain
 mix the marinade ingredients, put the meat in the mixture and
refrigerate for at least 12 hours, 2 days if possible.

 pat the meat dry, and set it on the dryer racks for 2-3 days. (check by
snapping a piece)

note for a stew or stirfry, cut beef into very thin strips 3-4 inches long,
for snack jerky simply slice the steak very thin.


      WINE MARINADE FOR BEEF JERKY

  for 2 pounds of lean beef (chuck, round, sirloin)

  1/2 cup red wine
  1 tablspoon red wine vinegar
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  2 fresh garlic cloves, minced
  2 tablespoons minced onion
  1 bay leaf
  pepper
  pinch each of thyme, oregano, and marjoram

slice the beef across the grain as thin as you can
mix the marinade ingredients, put meat in the mixture, and refrigerate
(12 hours -- to 2 days if possible)
as above, pat the meat dry, place on racks and dry for 2-3 days
(Note up here, meat drys within a day -- must be a difference in
humidity -- I find the snap test the best way to check, rather than
relying on number of hours drying time)

a couple of extra notes  --

before stir frying jerky, soak for 30 minutes, before using in a stew
soak it as long as you can, at least an hour

and pack dental floss or toothpicks  (Im sure you know this part!!)

anyway  --- hope this helps  -- I highly recommend the book, we
find it an excellent source of lightweight, filling recipes for
canoe trips -- and the jerky stirfry is usually a highlight of
any trip

I make up a lot of my own marinades -- one that works well is simply
honey mixed with minced garlic and soy sauce
lemon juice, brown sugar, and a little salt
(I usually through things
in until it tastes right)

or if you like thai food -- try mixing a peanut type marinade  -- we
love this one  -- peanut butter, with water, indonesian or sweet soy sauce,
sambal (red pepper sauce), lemon juice, -- just mix over low heat until
you have a sauce consistency and the taste seems right -- this is
excellent for stirfrys
anyway, experiment almost anything will work -- and its a lot cheaper and
a lot tastier than the stuff you buy (thats why we got into it in the
first place too)
cheers!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biltong is a South African version of beef jerky.


Biltong is usually made from venison, beef or ostrich meat (the latter may
pose a problem to you, as would elephant biltong which is readily available
in RSA and in my view the most delish...) and during the cool, dry months
of the year (do you have any cool, dry periods?). Now that I live in Oz I
tend to use beef - the tender cuts are the best, fillet, rump and sirloin,
it is not cheap!

For every 25kg of meat allow
    1.25kg good salt,
    250ml brown sugar,
    50ml bicarb of soda,
    20ml salpetre,
    25ml ground pepper,
    100g coarsely ground coriander seed.

Cut meat across the grain into 5 - 7cm thick strips, trying to leave some
fat on each piece. Mix salt, sugar, bicarb, saltpetre and coriander and rub
this into the strips of meat. Layer meat in plastic or enamel container and
sprinkle a little vinegar over each layer. Leave for 24 - 48 hours. Dip
meat into a mixture of 500ml vinegar and 5 litres water. Pat dry, then hang
on s - shaped wire hooks about 5cm apart, free air circulation, for 2 - 3
weeks. If weather is not cool, make strips about 2cm thick. When dry (the
degree of dryness is a matter of personal taste) slice thinly and serve
with beer.
enjoy!

This is the first part of my jerkey summary...a few people had asked
for the recipies that I got.   I didn't get very many responses, but
thanks to those of you who were kind enough to reply.  Special thanks
to Bob (you know who you are) who sent me a bunch of recipies.  Anyway,
I'm going to post all of them, but only a few at a time, to build the
anticipation.  Since all the methods are essentially the same, I'll
put the method in first, followed by the various ingredient lists.

For measurements, tblsp = tablespoon and tsp =  teaspoon.

General jerkey method:

All recipies use 1 lb lean meat, thinly sliced. (3/16-1/4 in thick)

In a small glass bowl, combine all ingredients except meat.  Stir to mix
well.  Place meat 3-4 layers deep in a container, spooning sauce mixture
over each layer.  Cover tightly and marinate 6-12 hours in the 'fridge,
stirring occasionally and keeping the mixture covered.

I can't really help with drying instructions, but i'd say somewhere between
7-10 hours, depending on how you like it.

I've had a food dehydrator for about a year now, and have used it extensively
for backpacking foods. Nearly everything I've tried works great.

Here are all the recipes I've gotten from the net. There are some recipes
for jerked chicken at the end.

BTW I have never dried fowl in the dehydrator. I'm not sure whether it is
safe to do it or not because of samonella (sp?). If you have or get any
info on drying fowl, please send it along.

Happy drying!

  -------------------------------------------
  GRILLED JAMAICAN JERK CHICKEN

  1/4 cup Inner Beauty, or other Caribbean hot sauce, or 10 pureed Scotch
          Bonnet chile pepper, or 15 of your favorite fresh chile peppers
  2 tbsp dried rosemary
  2 tbsp parsley, chopped
  2 tbsp dried basil
  2 tbsp dried thyme
  2 tbsp mustard seeds
  3 scallions, finely chopped
  1 tsp salt
  1 tsp black pepper
  juice of 2 limes
  1/4 cup cheap yellow mustard
  2 tbsp orange juice
  2 tbsp white vinegar
  6 chicken thighs, with legs attached

Combine all the rub ingredients in a food processor, or blender, and
blend them into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are fully
integrated.  The paste should be approximately the consistency of a thick
tomato sauce.  If it is too thick, thin it out with a little more white
viegar.  Cover the paste and let it sit n the refrigerator for at least 2
hours for the flavors to blend together.  Overnight is the ideal amount
of time to give them to get acquainted. (**NOTE** If you want to avoid
making a fresh batch every time you make this dish, you can multiply the
amount of paste easily.  Don't worry about it going bad, since it keeps
almost infinetely.)

Rub the chicken thighs with paste and place them on the grill over very
low heat.  If you have a covered cooker, put the coals to one side and
the chicken on the other, and cover.

Cook about 1 hour without a cover or 1/2 hour if covered.  The key here
is to use a very low heat.  You need to be patient and give yourself
plenty of time.  The chicken is technically done when the meat is opaque
and the juices run clear.  However, the ideal is about 10-15 minutes past
that point, when the meat pulls away from the bone easily.  It is very
hard to overcook this.  In fact you can only screw it up if you burn the
paste by having the heat too high.  The longer the chicken stays on the
grill, the more superior the smoky flavor.  After cooking, separate the
leg from the thigh by cutting at the natural joint between them.  Serve
one leg or thigh per person accompanied by a few spoonfuls of
Banana-guava ketchup.

Serves 4 and as entree or 6 as a light meal.

  Title: JAMAICAN JERK SAUCE

  1/2 cup Ground Allspice
  1/2+ cup Brown Sugar
  6 - 8 Garlic cloves
  4 - 6 Scotch Bonnet Peppers (or equivalent) seeds and all
  1 TB ground Thyme, or 2 TB thyme leaves
  2 bunches Scallions
  1 tsp Cinnamon
  1/2 tsp Nutmeg
  Soy sauce to moisten (2 TBS)

Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth. You may
 use allspice berries, if available, but use enough to give the
 equivalent of 1/2 cup ground. This will keep "forever" in the
 refrigerator. Feel free to increase the garlic, and the hot peppers.
 I do. The recipe, double, and triples very well.

Rub about 1/4 cup sauce into each chicken, halved, and get under the
 skin and in all the cavities. It is is pork, use a de-boned
 shoulder, score the fat, and rub the sauce in, using 1/2 cup, or
 more, per 6 lb shoulder. Use less for fish.

Marinate, preferably overnight, and grill over a low fire, until
 done. Charcoal is ideal. The meat will be a smoky pink when done,
 and the skin nice and dark. Chop the meat into pieces, and serve
 traditionally with a hard-dough bread, and LOTS of Red Stripe Beer!

My favorite (and easy) jerky recipe is:

1 part liquid smoke
2 parts worchestershire sauce
4 parts soy sauce
black pepper to taste

trim favorite meat and slice 1/4' thick marinate overnight and dry.  I have a
dehydrator, but the Joy of Cooking says you can dry jerky in the oven by
setting in to 170 degrees and hanging the strips from the racks.  I haven't
tried this.  I assume you need to prop the door open to release the moisture.

Atlast, the long awaited continuation to the jerky summary.  It seems
that a few people couldn't wait for the rest of the recepies (sp?) and
got a bit...over-anxious...so...here's the rest of what i have...again,
many thanks to Bob  for sending 'em to me...

Curried Jerky
1 tsp salt               1-1/2 tsp curry powder

and finally....Bob's Own Beef Jerky
I haven't tried this one yet, but i think i will when i have the
time to go hunting around for more spices...

Bob's Beef Jerky

4 tbs soy sauce          4 tbs Worcestershire sauce
4 tbs teriyaki sauce     1/2 tsp liquid smoke
1 tbs corriander         1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp pepper
1 tbs ketchup (he uses hot ketchup)

He suggests playing around with it.  Adding more pepper or garlic.
Maybe a bit of red wine.  Or anything else that sounds good.

Anyway....that's it...so far I've been pretty happy with things so
far.  And the dried fruit is great too...the fresh stuff works best.
Much better than processed stuff from a can.

Anyway...have fun...I did.
