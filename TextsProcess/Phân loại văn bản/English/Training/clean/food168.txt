                        salt
                        celery tops

  1/2  cup              COCA-COLA
3-1/2  Tbsps            flour
    1  cup              coffee cream or undiluted evaporated milk
    1  tsp              salt

Rinse the chicken pieces.  In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the chicken
with a few celery tops.  Cover and simmer about 1 hour or until fork-tender.
Drain and strain the broth; reserve.  Bone the chicken and cut it into 1/2-inch
pieces to measure about 2-1/2 cups.

In a skillet, melt the butter/margarine.  Add the apple, onion, and curry
powder and saute for 5 minutes, blending well.  Stir in the raisins, 1 cup of
the reserved chicken broth, and the Coca-Cola.

In a bowl, mix flour with the coffee cream/evaporated milk, stirring until
smooth.  Add with salt and white pepper to the onion/apple mixture.  Stir and
cook over low heat until thick and creamy.  Taste for seasoning.  Add the
chicken and turn into a covered container to chill overnight.

Reheat in the top of a double boiler over hot water and serve on cooked rice
with a selection of condiments (See NOTE below).  Makes 6 servings.

NOTE:  Provide a sampling of the following condiments for sprinkling on top of
       each serving:  grated coconut, chopped peanuts, chopped raw onions,
       raisins, sweet pickle relish, chutney, chow chow, and/or lime wedges.
