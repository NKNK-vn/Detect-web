Comments:
But in my packing frenzy I came across a bedraggled recipe
from a local store that I'm going to try the next time I see
SHARK in the market.  It looks pretty good, and could
probably be done with halibut or tuna (the fillet version,
not the canned junk), or any really firm-fleshed fish.
(coelacanth?? ;> )
Serve this low calorie treat with salt, pepper and Tabasco
sauce at the table. Plan on sorbet for dessert to cool the
tongue.
