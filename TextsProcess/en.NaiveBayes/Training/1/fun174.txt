    ESTIMATED IQ'S OF FAMOUS PEOPLE IN HISTORY 1450-1850
============================================================
The following list appears in the Book of Lists,
Walleninsky, Wallace and Wallace, 1977, William Morrow &
Co., and is originally from a study which appears in:
"Genetic Study of Genius" Vol. 2, by Catherine Morse Cox,
copyright 1926 Stanford Press. The IQ's are estimated based
upon various analytical elements, including performance
before the age of 17. Presumably, these are on the Stanford-
Binet scale.
