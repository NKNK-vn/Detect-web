    The following is an outline of the late 20th-century events prophesied 
    by the 16th-century French psychic known as Michel Nostradamus.  
    Nostradamus has predicted in great detail such events as the French 
    Revevolution, World War I, Hitler's Rise and Fall, and even the Kennedy 
    Assassinations.  Nearly two-thirds of all his predictions have come 
    true.  If two-thirds of this comes true, we're in for some trouble!  HBO 
    produced a movie called "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow," which documents the 
    life and predictions of Nostradamus.  These prophecies are based on and 
    adapted from the book, NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTS THE END OF THE WORLD by Rene 
    Noorbergen, who wrote several books on psychics.
    
    I have drawn on a world map with colored markers all of the invasions,
    nuke strikes, etc., with the number of each event placed with the 
    respective arrows and circles on the map.  Print this up and save it,
    then compare Nostradamus's predictions to actual world events.  You may
    be surprised!

    THE PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS, summarized by Mike Brown 4/86 and 8/86   
    From "Nostradamus Predicts the End of the World," Copyright (c) 1981
    by Rene Noorbergen.  Note: These are not necessarily in exact order.
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    (1)    Communism in Russia will decline, beginning in the Ukraine as a
           result of trade differences with the West.  This will occur
           around Easter.
    
    (2)    The United States and Russia will become better friends.
    
    (3)    A great power will unify the Far East with negotiation and 
           pressure.
    
    (4)    This power will disrupt peace attempts, and the Middle and Far
           Easterners will attempt to settle their differences with force.
    
    (5)    A meteor will strike the center of the Indian Ocean, causing 
           tidal waves that will heavily damage the surrounding lands.
    
    (6)    A powerful dictator will dominate the Middle East.  He will 
           tyrranize Syria, Iraq, and Jordan.  [Maybe Khomeini?]
    
    (7)    On August 2nd, 1987 he will attack Iran, Turkey, and Egypt with
           an army of nearly a million men.  [This date was reached by
           astronomy; the astronomical event only occurs on that day.]
    
    (8)    Arab forces in Tunisia and Algeria and north-Moroccan guerillas
           will invade Morocco's pro-Western monarchy and overthrow its
           king.
    
    (9)    Israel will be defeated by the Arabs, with her airforce
           destroyed.
    
    (10)   A Libyan leader will create much tension in Europe.  [Definitely
           Khadaffi.]
    (11)   A "red one" [a Cardinal of the Roman Church or maybe a TWA jet]
           will be taken by Arab terrorists at sea.
    
    (12)   The Arabs will try to unify more of Africa by overthrowing 
           pro-Western governments.  The Oriental leader will do the same.
    (13)   Arab armies will threaten central & southern Africa into
           alliances favorable to the Middle-East.
    
    (14)   The Arab attacks in Turkey will be followed by attacks on the
           Greek navy.  The U.S. will attempt to resupply the navy, but
           Cyprus will be lost to the Arabs.
    
    (15)   A series of tremendous earthquakes originating in Central Asia
           will cause destruction throughout the warring Greece and Turkey.
    
    (16)   Romania and Bulgaria will threaten war with the Arabs when the 
           Bosphorus Straits are cut off, thus interfering with commercial 
           and military ship movements.
    
    (17)   The U.S. and U.S.S.R. will form a military alliance against the 
           both the Far Eastern power and the Arabs.  The U.S. will grow in
           fame, praise, rule, and power, and will even threaten the East
           with war.
    
    (18)   Geneva talks will fall apart, with the feeling that peace is
           unattainable.  [Uh-oh here it comes.]
    
                            **   WORLD WAR ]I[   **
    
    (19)   China will launch a surprise nuclear biological-warfare attack
           over the Arctic, affecting Scandinavia, Northern Russia, Alaska,
           and Canada.  Another attack will originate from a space vehicle
           270 miles up.
    
    (20)   The Chinese will invade France by way of southern Russia,
           conquering all in their path.
    
    (21)   The Turks will sign a treaty with the Chinese, but it will be
           broken when Arab naval forces from Tripoli (Libya) attack the
           west coast of Turkey.
    
    (22)   The Chinese army will devastate northeastern Turkey with the aid
           of nukes.
    
    (23)   The Arabs and Chinese will attack Greece with germ warfare, which
           will affect the environment for 9 months.
    
    (24)   Albania, China's ally, will invade Greece in a surprise attack
           using light armored vehicles.
    
    (25)   A Western coordinated counter-offensive launched from Portugal
           will delay an amphibious assault on Yugoslavia by [guess who].
    
    (26)   The Easterners will advance into Yugoslavia and unleash
           bacteriological weapons in central Italy to hinder Western
           counter-attack efforts.
    
    (27)   Greece and Italy will be attacked simultaneously by the Eastern
           forces.
    
    (28)   When Yugoslavia is overrun, a devastating drought will hit Italy.
    
    (29)   Italy will dissolve into dissenting factions and go into its own
           civil war.  The Albanians will further promote the civil war by
           paying off corrupt government officials.
    (30)   Eastern forces will attack Rome from Albania using aerial
           bombardment and germ weapons.  They will attack Venice.  Central
           Mediterranean islands will be evacuated, even as far as Malta.
           Venice will fall.
    
    (31)   The French fleet will be destroyed in the Adriatic Sea as it
           tries to cut off the Easterners in Italy from their Albanian
           suppliers.  The French and Italian naval defeats will keep food
           from reaching the starving Italians.
    
    (32)   The Easterners will develop a new land/sea weapon to attack
           coastal areas.
    
    (33)   The Easterners control of the Po Valley from Venice will give
           them total rule.  A French/Italian attampt to forstall Italy's
           fall will be crushed.
    
    (34)   In order to avoid being wiped out, the French commander will
           withdraw and regroup his soldiers along the Po in the upper 
           valley.
    
    (35)   England will partially sink as a result of geological alterations
           and cause the deaths of 250,000 people.  [This event has been
           foreseen by at least 4 other famous psychics, also.]
    
    (36)   An Easter earthquake will rip open an English temple.
    
    (37)   Around New-Year's, the Easterners will begin a massive invasion 
           of the western Italian coast, southern France, Sicily, Corsica,
           and Sardinia by the use of nuclear and germ weapons.  The French
           fleet will be obliterated.
    
    (38)   The Papacy will leave Rome and a new Pope will be elected.
    
    (39)   The French armies will be cut off in Northern Italy.
    
    (40)   Prince Albert will be kidnapped in North-Central Italy after the
           French unsuccessfully try to cut Eastern supply lines from 
           Venice.
    
    (41)   The French will again regroup their forces, and will capture a
           beachhead.  This will be a turning point in the Franco-Chinese
           war.
    
    (42)   Ill-timed French-Italian attacks will cause the loss of Florence
           and Siena by Eastern nukes, and Pavia will be lost by the use of
           germ weapons.
    
    (43)   Monaco and Genoa will be annhilated by the Easterners.
    
    (44)   Ten assassins will be sent to murder the commander of the French
           fleet, but they will fail and a sea battle will take place.  The
           French will again lose their forces on land and sea.
    
    
    (45)   A battle will be fought at the major French port of Marseilles,
           creating an opening through which the attackers can enter.  The
           resulting massacre of nearly half a million Frenchmen will make
           people flee far northward.
    
    (46)   Toulouse, Foix, and Narbonne will be taken.
    
    (47)   Bacteria will spread northward.
    
    (48)   Easterners will release deadly bacteria from specialized ships at
           France's port, Agde.  Airforces will bomb Switzerland and
           Germany.
    
    (49)   Extensive use of nuclear and germ weapons will compose the first
           phase of the Eastern offensive against all of Europe, striking in
           France, Italy, and Spain.
    
    (50)   The Chinese will attack France via air, sea, and mountain.
    
    (51)   The Easterners will invade the Balkans to cut off the U.S.S.R.
           from its Eastern European allies.
    
    (52)   A North-African fleet will enter the Black Sea and attack
           Romania, Bulgaria, and southwestern Russia.
    
    (53)   A Chinese/Arab assault from Morocco will attack southern Spain
           with nukes.  This will be followed by an invasion along the River
           Guadalquivir.  The invasion will procede northward, with the
           destruction of Seville, Barcelona, and Leon.  The Spanish will
           halt the advance for 7 months at the River Ebro, but they will
           eventually be crushed.
    
    (54)   An Allied fleet will destroy supply bases in the Cyclades, but 
           will be defeated near Malta, when the French lose Italy.
    
    (55)   Eastern bombers will attack deep into Europe with bacteriological
           weapons.
    
    (56)   Switzerland will fall by the hand of the Easterners, who will
           confiscate the gold reserves and impoverish the Swiss people.
    
    (57)   The Easterners will start extensive bombing of central & northern
           French cities in preparation for a land attack.  The French will
           fly in defenses beforehand, though.  Central France will be
           overrun regardless.
    
    (58)   Paris will be surrounded, and attempts to get Allied air support
           will be in vain.  Paris will surrender after Eastern forces find
           a weak spot in the defense, enter the city, and engage in hand-
           to-hand combat.  The surrender will only be a cover to organize a  
           counter attack a week later.  That will surprise the Easterners,
           but they'll drive the Parisians back into the city.  Over 300,000
           will be killed or imprisoned.  Paris will be completely defeated.
    
    (59)   A British taskforce will land in southwest France and attempt to
           reach Paris, but will be stopped at Poitiers.
    
    
    
    
    (60)   The British will reorganize in Canada and send an invasion force
           to establish a beachhead on France's southwest coast.  With the    
           aid of nukes, they march on to Bordeax and Toulouse.  The British  
           plan will be to cut off occupied Spain from France and also to     
           gain an opening into the Mediterranean.
    
    (61)   A sudden attack from the Easterners will slaughter British and     
           American forces and will allow the Chinese leader a new command    
           center, Carcassone.
    
    (62)   He will detontate a series of high-altitude, high-yield atomic     
           devices which will ignite the atmosphere and cause a firestorme    
           over southwest France, but this will also cause his own base to    
           be destroyed.
    
    (63)   The Scots, left on their island, deny Britain permission to use    
           their land for a military base, and seek Eastern aid when British  
           forces invade out of desperation.  The resulting battle will       
           defeat the British.
    
    (64)   All life in London will die out during winter as disease sweeps    
           what is now the city-island.
    
    (65)   Poland and East Germany will ally with the Easterners and strike   
           against the smaller countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria,   
           and West Germany.
    
    (66)   West Germany and Austria will be invaded.  West Germany's border
           will be split down the middle again.  Netherlands, Belgium, and    
           northern France will also be raided.
    
    (67)   At the same time of the German/Austrian invasions, Western forces  
           will attack the Persian Gulf to weaken the heart of the Middle     
           East.
    
    (68)   German leaders will cause the downfall of Central European         
           defenses, along with Eastern attacks from East Germany and         
           Yugoslavia.
    
    (69)   The Allies will make their last stand at Bruges in northwest
           Belgium.  The Eastern Forces will dominate nearly all of Europe.
    
                     **   The Allies take the Offensive **
    
    (70)   Nuclear stikes will be made against America and Russia, and food
           will become in short supply.  The U.S. will be forced into         
           economic chaos, with looters and riters raiding banks and shops    
           for food, money, and supplies.
    
    (71)   A CONFLAG (Cluster Orbital Nuclear Fire-weapon for Light           
           Atmospere iGnition) system will be launched from China and
           detonated above New England, burning as far south as New York
           City.
    
    (72)   New York will be partially destroyed by a great earthquake that
           will partially sink Manhattan island.
    
    (73)   The Orientals will attempt to invade the U.S. near New York, but
           the U.S. navy will easily repel their attack.  American Orientals  
           will be placed in "protective custody."
    (74)   The Easterners will infiltrate Latin America and murder the        
           president of Brazil.  Their navy will attempt to take the Panama   
           Canal, but it will be unsuccessful and the attacking force will    
           be obliterated.
    
    (75)   The U.S. and Russia will resort to germ warfare to retalliate.
    
    (76)   The U.S.S.R. will be invaded from three directions, but careful
           preparation will allow them to use chemical weapons against the
           Chinese.
    
    (77)   To prepare to attack Asia, Eastern forces will set up Pacific
           defenses.  They will entrap a U.S. fleet, but Russia will aid the
           encircled Americans and help to defeat the Chinese navy.
    
    (78)   The American Air Force will make bombing runs deep into Europe.
           Seven months later the U.S. and Russia will make a joint attack 
           on China that will last a full week without stopping.  The
           Eastern forces will be defeated in their homeland, thus severely
           weakening their power.
    
    (79)   Scotland and London will be recaptured by the Allies.  A new
           Middle-Eastern commander will make his headquarters in Rome.
    
    (80)   Scandinavia, the Baltic states, and the Balkans will all be
           attacked by the Allies.
    
    (81)   The British will liberate southwest France, which will be          
           reinforced by other Western armies.  The allies will penetrate
           from La Rochelle into central France, to Roanne.  Another
           invasion force will land near Calais and slowly make its way to
           northeastern France.
    
    (82)   Central and Southern France will be liberated as the Allies
           continue to push onward.
    
    (83)   The Arabs and Far Easterners no longer will be able to work        
           together after the defeats in the Pacific, and this weakens their  
           still-resisting armies.
    
    (84)   Many battles will be fought as Allied forces make their way to
           Marseilles, the Easterners' stronghold and supply port.  This      
           will be coordinated with a submarine assault on southern France.
    
    (85)   French and British forces will seize the Spanish city of           
           Barcelona, and move on to aid in the successful Allied attack on   
           Marseilles.
    
    (86)   Nice will be retaken, but the Arabs will attack from Spain and
           Italy, recapturing parts of southern and southeastern France.  At
           the same time, the Arabs will launch a missile attack against the
           Allies in Northern France.  This attack will be unsuccessful, and
           the Arabs will be driven back.
    
    (87)   The Allies will use bacteriological weapons against Lausanne,
           Switzerland, forcing the Arabs to retreat.
    
    (88)   Spain will be reconquered after a large naval battle on March
           3rd, 1996.
    
    (89)   The Allies will make a massive onslaught into Italy, liberating
           it.  The Church will be returned to Rome.
    
    (90)   The Arabs will be forced all the way back into northern Africa,
           but a French force will be annihilated as it tries to cross the
           Adriatic Sea.
    
    (91)   The Allies will attack the Mediterranean islands.
    
    (92)   A secret and very successful raid will be made by the Allies to
           free POW's in Turkey.
    
    (93)   Southern Arabia will be nuked by the Allies, but the Arabs will
           recapture Sicily.  This will have little effect, though, and soon
           all of central Europe will be liberated.
    
    (94)   5000 Far Easterners will die when losing Crete and Greece to the
           Allies.
    
    (95)   The French, under a new leader named Ogmios, will lead an Allied
           assault on Turkey between May 25th and June 21st, 1996.  The       
           Arabs there will be defeated.  Northern Turkey will be liberated   
           on October 3rd.
    
    (96)   Western amphibious attacks will fail, and Arab saboteurs will      
           destroy an Allied military base after a defeat in one battle.
    
    (97)   In a surprise attack, the Western forces will attack and defeat
           the Eastern navy.
    
    (98)   Allies will infiltrate the Middle East, stabbing into occupied
           Israel, Syria, and Jordan.  Arab resistance will disintegrate,     
           and within a month the last Eastern forces, in Central and South   
           America, will surrender.  Israel will be liberated.
    
    (99)   The Westerners will attack Middle Eastern positions in India,      
           defeating all.
    
    (100)  The desparate Arabs will fight 3 last-ditch battles in eastern     
           Iran and Northeastern Turkey.  The last battle will bring about    
           the collapse of the Arab empire.  The Arab commander-in-chief      
           will be killed in his own headquarters.
    
    (101)  The battles will eventually cease in Iran, and World War ]I[ will
           finally be over.  The Allies win again!
