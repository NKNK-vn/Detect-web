                  <<<<<Orphan Annie's 6th Adventure>>>>>
 
     Larry  found out about Norman.  Well, yes, I told  him,  but 
only  after he really got insistent about why I didn't answer  my 
phone all that weekend (come to think of it, Norman had unplugged 
his phone, too...).  He was real upset, not that I'd promised him 
fidelity  but  certainly  I  could  understand  where  his   hurt 
expectations had come from.  So I invited him over for dinner and 
a talk, and perhaps a pityfuck.
 
     I selected a satin slipdress--you know, tailored,  spaghetti 
straps, trim fitting, low cut but not really dipping too far into 
the cleavage.  I picked up some fresh fish and vegies and put  on 
a  really nice table and candlelight, but he  wasn't  interested.  
Poor  guy was really hurting, I could see it in his face.   After 
all we had together, etc., etc., he kept saying, and I could tell 
he just never believed that the whole situation was merely a day-
to-day  thing.   Funny how guys never complain about  who  you've 
seen before, but they really get hurt when you see someone later!  
When I explained that I hadn't really given him up, just  allowed 
someone  else  in, he seemed to brighten a bit and  his  appetite 
began to come back.
 
     So  I  poured us a little more wine and let him  talk.   His 
work had been going better, and he'd wanted to share it with  me, 
and  here  I'd  gone off for a weekend with  a  year-old  reject.  
Again,  I  patiently  explained how there'd  been  no  long  term 
promises,  just mutual enjoyment.  We finished desert,  I  poured 
some brandy, and we retired to the living room sofa.  He was much 
more  relaxed,  and actually began to ask after  me  (other  than 
regarding   Norman,   of  course).   I   sketched   out   current 
projects...nothing he didn't already know about, but they  seemed 
to amuse him.  But conversation about him was really short:   How 
was work?  Ok.  What about his spare time?  Nothing special.  Was 
he  going out with anyone else?  No, of course not.  Did he  have 
any  trips  planned?   No, now that I  wouldn't  go  along,  he'd 
stopped  fantasying about them.  Well, where had he wanted us  to 
go?   Now  he brightened and began to recite a series  of  rather 
detailed  itineraries he'd thought through.  A bit TOO  detailed, 
in  that  EVERYthing was planned, but surely they were  all  very 
romantic ideas for weekends or longer.  When I said I'd go  along 
as things permitted he began to get excited again.
 
     He brought out some pictures he'd clipped, and I moved  over 
next  to him to see them.  He did have a great  imagination,  and 
his  enthusiasm was now really showing.  When I reached  over  to 
point out something in his books, I didn't mind at all letting my 
hand  linger in his lap.  He didn't grab for me right  away,  but 
did shift over to be right next to me.
 
     I  poured a little more brandy and the evening drew on.   We 
began to plan a trip, selecting a long weekend and picking  daily 
destinations.  Somewhere along here I kissed his cheek and he put 
his  arm  around  me.  I could feel him checking  for  the  (non-
existent) bra strap and panty line.  Just as we finished I got up 
to  get  more  brandy, and when I came back I sat  with  my  back 
against  the far armrest of the couch and beckoned to Larry.   He 
scooted  over  and  put his arm across my  waist.   I  sipped  my 
brandy,  gave  him his, and asked him if he wanted  to  stay  the 
night.   I  swear  he almost dropped his  snifter,  and  then  he 
smiled; he leaned over and kissed me, and I put an arm around his 
shoulders.
 
     When he sat up I put my snifter aside and took his,  holding 
one  hand  in  his lap while I reached over to  put  his  snifter 
aside.   I had to really stretch my arm and chest to  reach,  and 
I'm  sure  he stared closely at the swelling beneath  the  slip's 
bodice.  When I turned back I reached up to pull him down and  he 
pivoted his legs onto the sofa as he lounged beside me.
 
     He still seemed so unsure, though.  I stroked his head,  and 
kissed  his lips, but he was hesitant.  I took his hand  from  my 
waist  and moved it up to my breast, where I held it tight.   His 
hand, massive as always, was as warm and gentle as before.  As he 
kissed  my  neck I pulled my head back and just enjoyed  all  the 
sensations.   He soon had his hand inside the dress and  then  he 
slipped  the straps off my shoulders.  He was getting  the  idea!  
Time to find a little bare skin on this guy, too!
 
     I  rolled  sideways, so he could get onto the  sofa  better, 
then  began  working on his buttons, literal and  figurative.   I 
would undo a few then reach down between his legs for a good grab 
as  I kissed him deeply.  Soon, his shirt was off and  his  pants 
were open.  It wasn't long before his hand was off my breast  and 
was  sliding up my leg under the dress.  I lifted my hips and  he 
just  pulled  it off over my head as I sat up.  We then  went  to 
work on the rest of his clothes and when they were off I took him 
to the bedroom.
 
     The  sheets  were  cold but we had them  warm  soon  enough.  
There  was a lot of exploring we did, sliding our legs over  each 
other, tongues in ears, nibbles on necks, fingers on genitals.  I 
took him on my side, and I could see him sigh as he slid into me.  
Right away there wasn't the usual vigorous pumping, just sort  of 
a slow and gentle massage of all my innards.  I ran my hands over 
his chest, behind me to grab his balls, back up through his hair, 
and  all the time there was this gentle warmth suffusing  through 
me.  I was tightening down but not yet near explosion.
 
     Then  he rolled me over onto my back and began to pump  more 
quickly.  He put his legs outside mine and the pressures changed.  
Next, he started licking and sucking my chest again, and I  began 
to really pump back.  When he came it wasn't for long but it  was 
powerful,  almost like a firehose deep inside.  I shivered,  then 
shuddered, and then thrashed about in a wild, slow-coming  orgasm 
that left me breathless.
 
     With  the  exhaustion that brought, and the brandy,  I  soon 
fell  asleep.  Larry was there, gently again in the morning,  and 
we repeated the performance until the sun was at zenith.  He left 
a little more confident of himself and I lingered in bed, assured 
the attentions of two wonderful men.  Can life be sweeter?
