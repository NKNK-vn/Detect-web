 HERE IS AN ARTICLE ON ONE ,OF P-80'S MEMBERS WHO MANAGED TO 
DIG UP A LITTLE PUBLICITY. SILVER SPY. FROM THE U.S. NEWS AND 
WORLD REPORT (JUNE 3 85)

  WORLD OF SPY,17 YR OLD TINKER

  Silver Spy has everything going for him-comfortable  surroundings, a father who is an engineer. He ranks in the top 3 percent of his high-school class.  His SAT scores for college admission totaled 1,400 of a possible 1,600. He wants to attend Stanford or the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology. But in the eyes of the phone companies  he is a thief, and in the eyes of the law he's a criminal. Such  is the portrait of this 17-year-old computer "hacker" and phone  "phreaker who lives about 20 miles outside Boston. He spoke with U.S.News & World Report on the condition that neither his real  name nor hometown be revealed. Catch 22. Silver Spy runs one of  the most exclusive bullentin boards in the nation. Called Catch  22, it will have no more than 20 users, whose credentials will  be carefully checked. Silver Spy, who owns two personal  computers, wants to keep the user list small so that his board  is not infiltrated by authorities. He terminated Spy Master, an  earlier system, because of messages he received that threatened  him with arrest. He believes they came from FBI agents. The  youth says he has hacked, or tinkered, in a number of university and commercial computers, including some belonging to banks. But he maintains that he has never damaged a computer or compromised private information. "I'm out to learn as much as I can about a  system and not do any damage," he says. "I know people who  delete [destroy] files when they get into a commercial computer. There are little 12-year-olds who are so ecstatic about getting  into a computer that they fill all its memory with the  words,"Hacker was here." Phone phreaking-making toll calls that  are billed to other users-is another story: "Since most of the  people and boards I talk to are out ot state, I generally don't  pay for the phone calls. Some people could say it's immoral. I  know it's illegal." Then how does he justify calls for which  others are asked to pay? "I don't," replies Silver Spy.
