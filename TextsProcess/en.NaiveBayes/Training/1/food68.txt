Ingredients:
1 lb. filet of cod            1 large onion
1 leek                        3 - 4 carrots
2 tbsp margarine or butter    1/2 lemon
salt, pepper, seasoning       

Instructions:
If you are using frozen cod, let it thaw partially before
preparing it. The more you let it thaw, the firmer it gets
after cooking. So, if you like the cod "juicy", leave it a
little frozen. Cut vegetables into thin slices. Melt butter
/ margarine in a large pan, preferably cast iron or
Silverstone. When butter is melted, turn down heat and ad
vegetables. Cut fish into finger thick slices and distribute
evenly on top of vegetables. Sprinkle with juice from the
lemon (squeeze half a lemon over the pan).  Distribute salt
and pepper. Other seasoning by taste (soy - sauce, oregano,
whatever you like). Let steam for 15 - 20 minutes under a
lid. Serve on bed of rice or with potatoes. The steaming
produces quite a bit of gravy, so unless you want some
special sauce, you don't have to make any sauce.

Comments:
Very tasty, healthy and good looking fish - dish. I have
also successfully prepared slices of salmon the same way. If
you add a can or two of hermetized tomatoes and some water,
you get a tasty fish soup.   Please, if you make other
improvements or variations, let me know. ENJOY ! :)
