Metal Micky: I have the same problem you do. I don't like
veggies, so I end up eating only bread and dairy. One good
thing is pasta: most of the sauces you make for it have some
sort of vegetable content, which you need, but don't taste
like blah veggies. And I'm sure people in this room have
hundreds of sauce recipes.  :) Another good thing is
beans/chili. Lots of recipes for those, too.
