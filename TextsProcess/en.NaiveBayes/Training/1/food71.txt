Instructions:
Now comes the tricky part...
First you need to choose a vegetable oil for your dressing.
This oil should be light in taste as it is to be used as a
salad oil. I personally recommend Canola Oil if you can get
it. Otherwise, use sunflower or safflower oil. While
vigorously mixing the egg/vinegar mixture, you need to
slowly add the vegetable oil in a very thin stream. This is
why you should use an electric mixer. Otherwise, by the time
you finish with this step, your hand will fall off from
shear exhaustion.  You must add the oil until you reach the
proper consistency of Caesar dressing. It will take between
3-4 liters of oil. If you like your dressing super thick,
keep adding oil until it reaches that consistency. The most
important thing to remember is vigorous mixing and  an
extremely thin stream of oil. Should you happen to get
carried away and get it too thick; thin it down with an
equal combination of lemon juice and red wine vinegar. Now
that you're staring at this weird mayonnaise-looking
dressing, add the garlic/anchovy/caper mixture. Blend
together well by hand. Add a small amount of salt and fine
white pepper to your own taste.

Comments:
Ah! Caesar Dressing....Here is one of my favorite recipes
from my days as Chef de Partie at the Waterfront Bistro in
North Vancouver, Canada. A few thoughts first.....Almost
everybody uses tinned anchovies to make Caesar dressing.
Just be aware that tinned anchovies are sometimes overly
oily and salty. You might have to alter the recipe a bit if
you find this to be the case. Of course, you could leave the
anchovies out, but then it wouldn't be Caesar dressing
anymore, now would it? *winks* This recipe should make 3-4
liters (hopefully). I trimmed down the original recipe
amounts which were for a 16 litter pail *grin* BON APPETITE!
