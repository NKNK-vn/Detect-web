------------------/

Welcome to the first issue of Kibble: the cyberpoet's guide to virtual 
culture journal. Why 'kibble' you may ask? A logical question. Phillip K 
Dick fans will have already grep'd that 'kibble' is a word used in his 
famous tome "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep", which later was made 
into a movie we know as _BladeRunner_. Kibble then, is the extraneous 
stuff laying around. The things society has cast off to the junkyards and 
backyards everywhere. But more specifically, the refuge that has 
overflown the borders of the junkyards and that has begun to clutter up 
our streets, our minds, our friendships and our politics. Yes, there 
seems to be alot of kibble around these days. 

Who really gives a shit about the Whitewater affair. It's just political
kibble cluttering up my mind. I wanna know how to get more and better jobs
in Califormia. How to solve the war in the old Yugoslavia. And I want to
know why if there is so much extra wheat in America that we have to pay
people not to grow it, then why are there people starving today?  Kibble
is the drug war and the anti-gang crusade, instead of the education war
and the youth brigade crusade. Kibble is the gov'ts adoption of the
clipperchip when the clipper functions are already old tech and wasted
spending. Kibble is the FBI's attempt assemble an interception site on the
Internet for all datapackets. Kibble is the inability of one person to
smile at the next while walking down the street for fear of getting robbed
or shot. 

I guess this isn't so much the kibble zine as it is the anti-kibble zine. 
But that doesn't have quite the ring to it. So don't be fooled by the 
title. We accept Kibble and non-kibble alike (we don't like to 
discriminate). Can society exist without kibble? probably not, but as 
J.F. Sebastion feared, we might soon be consumed by our kibble. I join 
him in his concern.

Subject: Leahy to hold hearings on Clipper Chip!


Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier:

I have some good news to share with you.  Senator Leahy just sent me a
letter indicating that he *will* be scheduling hearings on the
Administration's Clipper Chip proposal.  I would like to thank all of you
who sent us messages to forward to him urging hearings.  I'm sure that
stack of messages we printed out made a significant impact on the Senator
-- the stack was over seven inches tall!  (We look forward to the day when
no trees will have to be sacrificed in the furtherance of democracy!)

And if you haven't written a message to Rep. Cantwell yet about her
proposed amendment to the Export Control Act, please do so and forward it
to cantwell@eff.org.  This is an address we set up to enable us to collect
messages in support of her bill.  We have been printing out messages and
delivering them each week -- so far we've received over 4500 letters of
support.  For more information on the Cantwell bill, send a message to
cantwell-info@eff.org.

Thanks again.  We'll let you know as soon as the Clipper hearing gets 
scheduled.

Sincerely,

Jerry Berman

Dear Jerry,

Thank you for forwarding to me the many thoughtful and informative messages
you received over the Internet regarding the Administration's recent
approval of an escrowed encryption standard, known as the Clipper Chip.

Many of the messages urge Congress to hold hearings to review the
Administration's Clipper Chip standard.  In fact, I intend to hold a
hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, which
I chair, to consider the important issues raised by the Clipper Chip.  I
will let you know when a date for the hearing is scheduled.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,

o How to get PGP o

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to ensure their own right to privacy, they get PGP :-).

Tired of sending your e-mail on postcards? Send me mail at
<qwerty@netcom.com with Subject "Bomb me!" to get Gary Edstrom's PGP FAQ
and my "Here's How to MacPGP!" guide. (They are also available by
anonymous ftp to netcom.com in /pub/gbe and /pub/qwerty).

PGP is the free encryption program designed by Phil Zimmerman, and is
available for most any computer.

-=- 3- Ongoing projects  |
-------------------------/

So you want to get in on the action. Here are some various projects which
are starting up or in process around the net. Like any other culture, the
net requires constant tuning and growth. These are some of the more overt
methods of doing just that. In addition these projects are a great way of
accomplishing what the cyberpoet is constantly searching for . . . a
net.community.

o Interpedia - Internet Encyclopedia mailing list

   This is to inform you about the proposed Internet Encyclopedia, or
   Interpedia and the mailing-list for discussion of it.

   The original idea, due to Rick Gates, was for volunteers to
   cooperatively write a new encyclopedia, put it in the public domain,
   and make it available on the Internet.  Participants on the
   mailing-list have expanded the concept by noting that the
   bibliography entries and references provided with Interpedia articles
   could include hypertext links to other resources available on the
   Internet.  Unlike any printed encyclopedia, the Interpedia could be
   kept completely up-to-date.  Indeed, it could include hypertext links
   to ongoing discussions, and perhaps evolve into a general interface
   to all resources and activities on the Internet.

   If you find these ideas interesting, please join the Interpedia
   mailing-list by sending a message to
   interpedia-request@telerama.lm.com with the body of the message
   containing the word 'subscribe' and your e-mail address, as follows:

What's this?  This is the initial announcement and invitation to DEF CON ][,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii coders, programmers, crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc..

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel

So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part ][?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we're heading to Vegas!

Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:

"DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years." -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World

"Toto, I don't think we're at COMDEX anymore." -- Coderipper, Gray Areas

"Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald's Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds."  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine

DESCRIPTION:

Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
We attempt to bring the underground into contact with "legitimate" speakers.
Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences.

While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the
evil hackers to party and wreak havok, it's just not the case.  People come
to DEF CON for information and for making contacts.  We strive to distinguish
this convention from others in that respect.

WHAT'S NEW THIS YEAR:

This year will be much larger and more organized than last year.  We have a
much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.  Because of this
we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect speaking to run
Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new things expected
include:

> An INet connection with sixteen ports will be there, _BUT_ will only
  provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
  bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
  network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection.

> There will be door prizes, and someone has already donated a Cell Phone
  to give away.

> Dr. Ludwig will present his virii creation awards on Sunday.

> A bigger and better "Spot The Fed" contest, which means more shirts to
  give away.

> More room, we should have tables set up for information distribution.
  If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
  designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
  convention space.

> A 24 hour movie / video suite where we will be playing all type of stuff.
  VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titals to show, or bring your own.

> Midnight Tech Talks on Friday and Saturday night to cover the more
  technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions.


WHO IS SPEAKING:

I was going to run a list of the current speakers we have lined up, but at
this point things are still fluid.  In a few months when the speakers list
is more solidified I will release it.  I'll name the poeple who have
committed to attending in the next announcement.  Trust me.

WHERE THIS THING IS:

It's in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel as follows:

        The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078
        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Tripple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax
        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap

   NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON ][
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, 'cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Don't let
   the hotel people get their hands on your baggage, or there is a
   mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas has killer unions.


OTHER STUFF:

If you check out Wired like 1.5 or 1.6 there was a blurb about the new
Luxor hotel with it's total VR experience.  It looks like the first true VR
ride / experience for a group of people, it seats eight.  Intense.  A friend
was just over there, and tested out the various rides.  Not to be outdone
the new MGM grand (Largest hotel in the world) has a ride called the R360
which is basically a gyroscope they trap you into with goggles.  We should
get a group together and make a mass trek over there and check it out.
If enough people are interested I'll call and see if we can book a time
to reserve space for a bunch of us.  Both are within walking distance.

I'll whip up a list of stuff that's cool to check out in town there so if for
some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
sites in the city of true capitalism.

MEDIA:

Some of the places you can look for information from last year include:

New Media Magazine, September 1993
InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2, #3 (Fall 1993)
Unix World, ???
Phrack #44

COST:

Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We're gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
cheapness.
