                  <<<<<Orphan Annie's 7th Adventure>>>>>
 
     While  Euclid  found  that a triangle was one  of  the  most 
stable geometric structures, it certainly isn't in human affairs.  
Well, I knew that going into one, but the pleasures of the  flesh 
are  too  great for a mere mortal such as myself.  I knew  that I 
couldn't keep both Larry and Norman.
 
     They are both great, and in different ways.  Norman is pure, 
sizzling,  unadulterated  breathtaking  sex;  I  can't  take  him 
anywhere  except my bedroom, but why would I want to?   We  don't 
talk much, but we communicate nonetheless, orally and  otherwise. 
Larry is unsure of himself, and as a rough tradesman not  someone 
my  father would immediately like (well, they met at  a  barbecue 
one  weekend, and it took a while for even some  conversation  to 
take  place, but at least he wasn't thrown out), but he's  gentle 
and  generous and we have great verbal communication.   Larry  is 
really  possessive, a problem even in a monogamous  relationship, 
and Norman doesn't care so long as he doesn't get AIDS.
 
     When  I  raped  Larry in the bathtub  the  other  afternoon, 
though, and he came back for more as soon as he was toweled  off, 
I  had  a sense that things were going to change.  He  had  never 
shown that much self-confidence, and all of a sudden he was  less 
a  toy and more a real man to deal with.  Uh-oh...I wasn't  going 
to be able to hold on to all of this.
 
     I guess Norman felt it, too, because the next night, after a 
slow  start  he got really frenzied, pumping away  in  me  almost 
frantically  for  an hour before we both collapsed in a  pile  of 
musky  sheets and slippery bodies.  God, he was like  candy...you 
just can't give up that kind of attention!
 
     Then,  the  next weekend, Larry took me out for  dinner  and 
dancing.  He was well dressed, he found a fabulous restaurant, we 
danced and swirled around the dance floor until the place closed, 
and  then we went home and literally fucked until the  sun  rose.  
He ate me until I was thrashing all over the bed, then he'd slide 
right  in  and excite me some more.  After he'd come, I  used  my 
lips  to get him excited again and we went at it all over. I  had 
hickeys  on my neck, my breasts, my thighs and my butt,  and  the 
windows  were well steamed in the morning.  I had to take  a  nap 
for  the better part of Saturday just to recover.  I thought  I'd 
sent Larry home, but when I awoke about 4:00 he was peeking  into 
the bedroom with some fresh coffee, and almost before I  finished 
that  we  were  at it again.  You've got  to  understand  what  a 
gorgeous  man  Larry is, and just how the  contrast  between  his 
coarse exterior and his caring behavior is so exciting:  I really 
can't keep my hands off him.  He even looks better in the robe he 
gave  me  than I do!  And I just love sliding my hand  up  inside 
that  robe  because I find such a wonderful cock  to  play  with!  
Then he took me out to dinner again and all he did was play  with 
his  food  while his hand was playing between my legs.   He  kept 
calling me "the most exciting person he'd met," and I had to  lie 
about Norman to return the compliment.  Which of these guys do  I 
keep around?
 
     I HAD to get Larry out by Sunday morning, because Norman was 
due  Sunday  afternoon.  We went out for a hillside  picnic,  and 
after  the wine was gone the local eagles had a terrific view  of 
human  anatomy  until the sun went down.  He didn't  say  anyting 
about  the hickeys, but he must have seen them!  Then we sort  of 
curled  up  in  the blanket and dozed on the  hillside  until  we 
awoke,  shivering, about midnight.  I gave him a hand job on  the 
drive back to my place, but insisted he leave so I could rest for 
Monday's  work.  I was reaching a point where I couldn't keep  up 
the pace of keeping two guys up.
 
     So you see the dilemma. What do I do?
