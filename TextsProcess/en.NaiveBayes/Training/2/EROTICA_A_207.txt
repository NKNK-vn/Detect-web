                  <<<<<Orphan Annie's 2nd Adventure>>>>>
 
     I  don't  know about for all of you down in the  chilly  Bay 
Area, but up here the weather was really nice Saturday.  So nice, 
in  fact,  that  it  encouraged me to engage  in  another  of  my 
exploits.  Not that I planned it, of course.
 
     I  packed  a lunch and headed for the river,  the  afternoon 
being just too hot, even for mint juleps in the back yard.  There 
was  some  barbecued chicken and a couple of  Calistogas  in  the 
fridge, so I threw them into the cooler with some ice, pulled  on 
a  swimsuit  and covered it with some other  clothes,  grabbed  a 
towel and a book, and left.
 
     I  have this favorite unnamed spot by the river,  sandy  but 
not  too populated.  You have to know the river roads to find  it 
and  I  guess that even though it's a pretty good beach  not  too 
many people know about it.  That's an advantage of being a local.  
When I parked I knew by the absence of other cars that there were 
very  few other people there, and when I walked onto the beach  I 
found one couple near the trail back to the cars, another  couple 
far down the beach, and this one guy about halfway down.  I'm not 
terribly shy, and decided to have a bit of fun.

     He  saw  me coming and I saw him looking me over.   I'm  not 
Fawn  Hall,  but  I  get my share of  admiring  looks;  this  was 
apparently one of them.  As I walked towards the guy I could  see 
he  was  worthy  of some admiring looks himself:   he  was  young 
(maybe  23--I never did find out), trim, nicely groomed  and  not 
too  hairy.  He also wasn't pasty white--you know, the  way  some 
guys  get  who spend too much time at a VDT.  So I  just  set  my 
things down sort of near him, but not right next to him, just  to 
see how he'd react.  I stood with my back to him as I pulled  off 
my shirt, being sure to stretch my back as I did so.  I also made 
sure  that  as I spread the towel out I was facing him,  so  that 
when  I bent down he could see my tits (not the swimsuit  doesn't 
gap THAT much, but he had a nice view of what little there  is!).  
I pretended to accidentally pull down my swimsuit bottom a bit as 
I  pulled  off my shorts.  Then I laid down and reached  for  the 
sunscreen.
 
     The  sunscreen  makes  me  glisten,  though  I  was  already 
beginning  to  do so just from the sun's heat.  I spread  it  all 
over, being sure to let him see how I tucked it under my top  and 
massaged  my inner thighs.  I lifted first one leg and  then  the 
other (a little Jane Fonda workout, here!) as I did the backs  of 
the calves.

     Just  as I was finishing my front, my audience got  up  from 
his  chair  and walked over--a bit stiffly, as he was  trying  to 
hide  a nice erection.  His buns hardly wiggled as  he  walked--a 
real nice ass.  He offered to put the oil on my back (men are  SO 
predictible!).  Well, I thought I'd let that one linger a bit  as 
I opened a Calistoga and gave it a nice suck, and then found  out 
his name was Bill, that he had gone to the same JC as I, and that 
he was indeed a few years younger than me.  I handed him the  oil 
and flipped over onto my stomach.  I reached behind and undid the 
knot at my back and asked him to go ahead.
 
     Bill  has done this before--he warmed the oil in his  hands, 
and started rubbing it in smoothly at first, then later  kneading 
the muscles.  I always appreciate experienced men!  He stared  at 
the  center  of my back, worked his way up to my  shoulders,  and 
then came down my sides.  I let him feel a bit of my breasts, but 
just the sides.  He worked down to the waistline and then started 
on my thighs.  He was giving me nice, long, slippery strokes,  as 
he  worked  his hand up to my butt.  He paid a lot  of  attention 
there, sliding his hand beneath the suit more than once and  more 
than  a  little  distance.  He was enjoying this as  much  as  I, 
though it WAS getting to be a bit more than I'd first planned.
 
     We had been talking but soon that degenerated into a  series 
of  murmurs as I just relaxed in the warm sun massaged  by  warm, 
knowing  hands with warm oil.  I would have fallen asleep  except 
that  my  butt  is  a very sensual place and  I  think  Bill  was 
beginning  to  discover  that.   Eventually,  I  reached  for  my 
waistband and simply lifted my butt enough to push the bottom  of 
my  suit  down a bit; he pulled it the rest of the  way  off  and 
finished massaging and oiling all of my bottom.  After awhile  he 
sat across the top of my things and began to work my back  again, 
but this time very clearly he was reaching around to my front  to 
my nipples.  Then he simply lay down on my back and I could  feel 
his very hard cock nestled into my crack; it felt fine!
 
     I opened my eyes and the other couples were not watching  us 
at  all.   I had Bill push up for a moment and I rolled  over  to 
take him into my arms.  He kissed me gently and I used my lips to 
nibble  his.  My legs were together but his cock felt just  fine, 
resting  just  above my clit, very clearly a  situation  we  both 
wanted to do something about.
 
     My shirt comes to just below my butt, so I had him reach for 
it and we took a walk over to a nearby grove of willows.  You can 
imagine  the rest.  After we were through, it was getting  to  be 
late afternoon and I let him go--I don't think he ever learned my 
name, and I don't know his last name.  But that beach'll never be 
the  same, and the willows are now named the "Mr.  Bill  Memorial 
Grove"--at least by me.
