 This  document reveals most of the poisons, toxins, venoms,  and
acids  that have been discovered in use around the  realms.   The
terms are described below.  Note that some of these are real-life
poisons and should NOT EVER be considered for anything other than
game use.  I REPEAT, THIS DOCUMENT IS ONLY FOR A GAME!!

Definitions:

  Poison:     Some  form  of  harmful substance  that  exists  in
              naturally with no alterations from PC's (Other than
              the collecting of said poison)

  Toxin:      A damaging substance that does NOT occur in nature.
              A toxin must be produced manualy by an alchemist or
              assassin.

  Mixture:    A  substance that is used as a poison, but must  be
              made and produced by magic.

  Venom, Spit:A sdamaging substance that is produced ONLY  within
              the  glands of an animal.  Generally thought to  be
              the  strongest  of the poison types, but  also  the
              hardest to collect.

  Acid:       A corrosive substance that either exists in nature,
              is  produced by an animal gland, or is produced  by
              someone.   Causes  damage  upon  contact  but   can
              usually be washed off upon initial contact to  stop
              damage, unlike a poison.

                      - Forms of Poisons -

Ingestive:    This form of poison is the most common.  To  effect
              a creature, it must first ingest the poison.   This
              means that the creature must eat the poison one way
              or another.  Getting a poison in this form is of  a
              normal cost.

Insinuative:  This form of poison will effect a creature just  by
              getting  it  into it's blood stream.  This  is  the
              form  of  poison that is used on weapons.  (And  in
              specialized  weapons as a Dagger of  Venom).   This
              form of poison costs an extra 50% to create (Cost *
              1.5)

Contact:      This form of poison will effect a creature just  by
              coming in contact with the poison.  This is one  of
              the most expensive and most dangerous forms.   Many
              a  user has slain themselves through  carelessness.
              This form of poison costs 300% normal cost (Cost  *
              3)   NOTE:  This form of poison is easily  bypassed
              by  thick  gloves.  However  I  have  heard  of  an
              assassin which mixes acid and poison for just  that
              sort of case.

Gas:          This  form  of poison is very dangerous.   It  will
              effect  EVERYTHING within range.  You will have  to
              pay a pretty gold piece for any alchemist to add an
              oxidizing  agent to a poison and it's EXPENSIVE  to
              ask someone to risk their life for that.  This form
              costs 1000% normal costs (Cost * 100).  The  normal
              effect  is  a sealed vial which  when  broken  will
              produce a 20' x 20' x 20' cloud of gas.

Antidotes:    Antidotes  are available if a sample of the  poison
              is  made  available.   The  antidote  usually  cost
              120%   of  the  purchace  price  of   the   poison.
              Antidotes  take approximately one week  to  create,
              and  must  be administered within 2 rounds  of  the
              toxification to be effective.  If no sample of  the
              toxin  is  availible, one cam be distilled  from  a
              blood  sample, but that will take  approximately  a
              month and a 1,000 extra gold (by then it's too late
              anyway).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
                        - NOTE TO GM'S -

      These  poison (toxins...etc...) have not been assigned  any
     price  or  dosage for effect (with few  exceptions).   These
     things are  up to you.  This also goes for  availability  of
     these and antidotes (Note thought that there are a few  that
     have no known antidote!)  The only other note I should  make
     is  to  keep these in control.  To many can really  throw  a
     game  out  of  balance.  For assassins  to  study  these,  I
     usually  allow them on type (Poison, Toxin,  venom...etc...)
     to  learn and they may learn how to use, collect,  produce..
     it  from 5th level on.  For each level afterwards, they  may
     learn one more from that type of poison.
