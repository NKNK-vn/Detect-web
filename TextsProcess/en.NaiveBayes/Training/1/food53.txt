				Spent Grain Bread

	I got this recipe from the 1985 Grain Brewing Issue of Zymurgy magazine.  I tried it as is, and wit bananas added and found it to make a good heavy bread.  The original article is by Clifford T. Newmn Jr. and he requests any original recipies to be sent to him at P.O. Box 193, Port Matilda, PA  1680

	-4 C. fresh spent grains (from your latest batch of 
	-1 C. water               all grain beer)
	-1/2 C. oil
	-1/2 C. sugar
	-1/4 tsp. salt
	-1 Tbsp. dry baker's yeast
	-All-purpose flour (enough to make a stiff dough)

	Place the spent grains and water into a blender or food processor and blend themn for 30 seconds. Ten put the blended grains in a large mixing bowl and add oil, sugar, salt and stir in the yeast. Addflour until you have a thick, workable dough. Put in a warm place to rise until doubled in size. The knead the dough and divide into three greased laof pans. Let the dough double in size again then bae in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for one hour and 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool on wre racks. Enjoy.

	For storing grains until ready to make the bread, place them one half inch deep in a shallow bakingdish or cookie sheet and put them into the oven at 200 degrees. Stir the grains about every half hou until they feel dry. Then store in tightly sealed containers. If you see any drops of moisture in te containers it means the grains need to be dried longer.

	Once dried, the grains will keep for a long time. They can be used dried or moist (fresh), and drie grains can be ground into flour. The recipe above is for moist (fresh) grains and if you are using ried grains, add on half cup of water for every four cups of grains in the recipe.

	I haven't tried the following recipe (yet) and am thinking of using wheat flour or flour from grain instead of white flour in my next batch of bread.
