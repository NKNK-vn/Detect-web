==============================================================================
Notes:
(1)  Layering, of different ingredients is achieved by pouring the
     ingredients over the back of a spoon, into a glass.

(2)  I always use proportions as guidelines only, and I think they should NOT
     be strictly adhered to, but experiment. We are doing it for the taste
     aren't we? For there are sure cheaper ways to get drunk!

(3)  This list was compiled by Peter Flodin (s3021421@ipc04.mpce.mq.edu.au),
     and is the result from editing a number of different lists and articles
     that have appeared on rec.food.drink .
     Obviously I haven't tried all these, any comments, additions and
     corrections appreciated.
  


		"THE ULTIMATE DRINK LIST"
	-from several people in alt.party and rec.food.drink.
	-put together by chattha@mailserver.sfu.ca.
	-thanks to everybody who posted.


When a recipe says one part, it means just that any equal part.
			    
	1 shot = 1.5 ounces = 44ml

A "shotglass" is usually 1.5 ounces, but sometimes 2 ounces with 
a measuring line at 1.5 ounces.  You can also buy (in US) "short shot" 
glasses or "pony shots" which are 1 ounce.  Pony shots are usually
used with martinis, manhattans, and rob roys.

	"Fifth" = 4/5 Qt. = 1/5 Gal. = 25.6 oz 	now =>  750 ml = 25.5 oz
	"Pint"	= 1/2 Quart 	= 16 oz		now =>  500 ml = 17.0 oz
        "Half-Pint" = 1/2 pint 	= 8 oz		now =>  200 ml =  6.8 oz	
	"Half-Gallon"		= 64 oz		now => 1750 ml = 59.7 oz
	"Quart" 		= 32 oz		now => 1000 ml = 34.1 oz


Well, let's see...8 oz = 1 cup = 250 mL...hmm, I think an ounce may be
0.03125 L (or 31.25 mL).  1 shot is one ounce, and 1 part just means to get
the ratio of the ingredients right (it doesn't matter what you use).  To
get % alcohol by volume, divide the proof by two.


Here's one which is quite popular at the moment here in Karlsruhe,Germany.
It's calles 'Orgasmus' (yes, 'orgasm') and mixed as follows:

1 part Tequila 
1 part Baileys

into a little glass. Looks like, um..., but tastes fine.


Here are a few recipies for like drinks. They all taste just... just...
("orgasmic", shouts the crowd) err yeah, orgasmic. And they're easy to 
make and bloody expensive. They're all made in a small liqueur glass, 
cos any more makes your nose fall off.

Apache
------
1 part Kaluha
1 part Baileys
1 part Midori melon 

Pour Kaluha into bottom of glass. Over the back of a spoon, add the 
Baileys. Same for the Midori on top. Serve more than one to each person. 
Upon command, everyone drinks contents of the glasses in one shot. Sit
back and watch.

B-52
----
1 part Kaluha
1 part Baileys
1 part Cointreau

Same procedure as above.

Blowjob
-------
1 part Kaluha
1 part Baileys 
Whipped cream

Same procedure as above, but place whipped cream on top. You may have to
suck or lick the cream off the top to get to the liqueur (hence the name?)

Orgasm
------
1 part Baileys
1 part Cointreau

Mix in small glass (tumbler?), not necessarily over ice (I think it 
wastes the taste). Drink slowly. Repeat. Pass out.

Screaming Orgasm
----------------
1 part Baileys
1 part Cointreau
1 part Galliano Liqueur (the yellow one)

As above.

etc.... Experimentation with liqueurs, if you can afford it, is a very
pleasant way to have your legs fall off of an evening. 


Blowjob:  1 part Irish Cream,  1 part Grand Manier, 1 part Creme de Banana

Girl is supposed to drink it with hands tied behind her back.
Picks up the glass with her mouth all the way around it and suck it down.
Everybody guesses whether she spits or swallows.


EverClear Jello (190 proof grain alc)
orange flavored jello
knox unflavored jello

take the 4 cup of water jello box and empty it into a bowl,  mix in 3 cups
of hot water and desolve jello, add two packets of knox unflavored jello,
then add one cup of everclear.  Pour into mold or for best results pour into
paper pill cups (small ones you get in the hospital) and let set.

hours later (2+) eat up, yum!

Vodka can be substituted for everclear with good results, just use two cups
of vodka and two cups of water.


Romulan Ale

1 jgr   Bacardi 151
1 jgr   Blue Curaco

A "guaranteed" success at any 21 party
and for later on that night

Vulcan Mind Probe
Wild Turkey, Ouzo, and 151


Bill: I am inferring from your emotional pleas for a drink recipe list that
you might enjoy mixing up this recipe which can be served as a jumbo drink or
strained as shooters.

AGENT ORANGE: 1 ounce each of Vodka, Rum, Gin, Southern Comfort, Yukon Jack,
Apple Schnapps, and Melon Liqueor.  2 ounces of Grenadine.  6 ounces of Orange
Juice.  Pour into 32 oz container filled to top with ice.  Shake well and
serve.  Make sure you have a designated driver if you drink the whole
concoction by yourself.

Here is a good one to try.  Get some fruit (apples, watermellon,  
oranges, bannanas, etc) and a bottle (or two, if you're really bold)    
of Everclear (can you guys get it up there?).  If not, use 100 proof  
vodka or 151 rum.  Slice up the fruit and let it soak by itself  
overnight in the alcohol.  Then add a 3-4 (maybe 5) cans of Haiwaian  
Punch and a bottle or two of something fizzy (ginger ale, seven up,  
etc.).  Enjoy and watch out for the apples, they hold the most  
alcohol.


Mix equal parts of ginger ale, grape juice, vodka, and grain
alcohol.  It's called "Purple Jesus."

Be prepared to have a lot of people spend the night!

top of this (over the back of a spoon), float the same measure of
Cointreau. 

Imbibe rapidly.


Here is a drink that I know everyone will enjoy.

Jamacia me crazy

In a tall glass pour
1/2 ounce amber rum
1/2 ounce tia maria
fill glass with ice
add pineapple juice

stir and enjoy.

An added touch is to put pineaple cubes in the drink.


I was sittin here readin the net when I thought of some drinks I made while I 
was in college.  These are drinks made with the bare essentials - nothing 
expensive, extravagant, and not found in the corner store.

	A few of my favorites were (read: are)

	Apple Pie -	one part vodka
    a little less than  one part apple juice
			cinnomon powder
			a small glass (~6oz, the little ones jelly comes in
								   are good)	
		Pour vodka into the glass 
		add apple juice
		a dash o cinnomon on top
		DO NOT MIX
	      Drink quickly
	When mixed in the right perportion the drink will taste like Grandma's
 	own.
	
	Apple Jack - 	substitute Jack Daniel's
			mix same
		Tastes like the cereal of same name.

	Shoot the Root -beer (the cheaper the better ;*)
			rootbeer shnapps
			12oz cup
			shot glass

		with a shot glass' height of beer in the cup
		drop shot glass full of shnapps in cup o beer 
	      Pound
	Adjust mix to taste like root beer.  Mmm Mmm good %*)


Mix in a punch bowl:

2 cups sugar
375 ml (1/2 bottle) inexpensive Brandy (say, Christian Brothers)
5 bottles decent cheap champagne (say, Frexinet)

then stir in

6 oranges, 6 lemons and 6 limes, sliced thin into rounds
1 pineapple, cut into chunks (canned will do, but fresh is better) 
1/2 bag of ice in small cubes or crushed (more or less to fit the bowl)

To complete, garnish with strawberries and pour a final bottle of
champagne theatrically over the top.  

Total cost is around $50 (maybe as low as $25 if you use really cheap
champagne) for about 50 drinks.


Here's my favorite punch that can be served any time:

             NULL & VOID PUNCH
             -----------------
             750ml  VODKA
             500ml  WILDBERRY SCHNAPPS
             500ml  PEACH SCHNAPPS
             375ml  SOUTHERN COMFORT
             2 liters of Hawaiian Punch

      Mix with ice in a Tupperware dish pan.  Serve in
      16 oz glasses (with caution).  Tastes great, but
      can lead to wastedness if comsumed too quickly, hence
      the name NULL & VOID punch.  Brought to you by TIKI.


	(Did you get the number of that)

		TRUCK PUNCH
		-----------

		1 Liter bourbon whiskey
		1 Fifth Apple Snapps
		1/2 Fifth Cinnamon Snapps
		2 Liters Squirt

Give yourself a break, use ice. :-)


I made this for a party a few weeks ago, out of stuff that I had
on hand and that sounded like it might taste good.  No measurements --
just to taste (and to color).  It was yummy.

Vile Green Stuff

Orange Juice
Soda water (seltzer, fizzy, whatever you call it)
Midori (what makes it green)
Peach Schnapps
--

1/5 Blue Hawaiin (sp) Maui Schnapps
1 gallon Orange Juice
1/5 Light Rum


Another drink that sounds rather interesting...

2 shots Coke
combine in beer mug

1/2 shot root beer schnaps
1/2 shot sambuca
combine in shooter glass

lower shooter glass into beer mug containing the J.D. and Coke

Chug

BERRY DEADLY
Try this one:

2 pints Everclear
1 bottle Boone Strawberry Hill Wine
1/2 gallon orange juice
1 gallon Tropical Berry Kool-Aid

This one will knock everybody on their ass!


Something a little More Refined...
    Strawberry Bolle

    3 bottles chilled Moselle 
    1 bottle chilled Champagne
    1 kg (2 pounds) sliced, hulled strawberries
    8 tablespoons sugar

    Sprinkle strawbs with sugar, add one bottle Moselle.  Chill for
    several hours.  To serve, pour into large bowl with ice, add the
    rest of the wine.  Serve in small wine glasses.

	
EVERYBODY'S IRISH
2 oz Irish Whiskey		1 oz green Chartreuse
1 oz green Creme de Menthe

	In a mixing glass half-filled with ice cubes, combine all of
the ingredients. Stir well. Strain into a cocktail glass.


ALGONQUIN
1 1/2 oz blended whiskey	1/2 oz dry vermouth
1 oz pineapple juice

In a shaker half-filled with ice cubes, combine all of the
ingredients. Shake well. Strain into a cocktail glass.


BABY'S BOTTOM
1 1/2 oz blended whiskey	1/2 oz white creme de cacao
1/2 oz white creme de menthe

In a mixing glass half-filled with ice cubes, combine all of the
ingredients. Stir well. Strain into a cocktail glass.


BAY HORSE
1 1/2 oz blended whiskey	1 oz heavy cream
1/2 oz Pernod			1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/2 oz dark creme de cacao

In a shaker half-filled with ice cubes, combine the whiskey, Pernod,
creme de cacao, and cream. Shake well. Strain into an old-fashioned
glass almost filled with ice cubes. Garnish with the nutmeg.


BOILERMAKER
1 oz blended whiskey	12 oz beer

Pour the whiskey into a shot glass. Pour the beer into a beer mug.
Drink the whiskey in one go. Sip the beer. Drink a Boilermaker only if
you are sober before you start and tough enough to drink whiskey in
one go.
	A variation is that you drop the filled shot glass directly
into the filled beer mug and drink the entire contents in one go.


MANHATTAN
2 oz blended whiskey		3 dashes Angostura bitters
3/4 oz sweet vermouth		1 cherry

In a mixing glass half-filled with ice cubes (doesn't this sound
familiar?), combine the whiskey, vermouth, and the bitters. Stir well.
Strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with the cherry.
I'm sure a few people are gonna wonder what the heck a bitter is.
Basically all they are is an herb. Its just something to add a little
different taste.


heheheh 

have phun with it!
