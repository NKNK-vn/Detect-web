Subject: Anti Valentine's Day Party results

In Canada and the US, St. Valentine's Day is used as a day to celebrate
love, where lovers get together and be romantic. And of course,
businesses use it as a chance to sell lots of cheesy cards and other
merchandise.

Despite the commercialism, we single people often feel left out, or
worse, feel inadequate because we have no-one to whom we can send
Valentine's greetings. Well, I thought that was pretty stupid. Enough
of that shit.

Borrowing an idea from friends up north (hi guys), a friend and I
organized an Anti-Valentine's Day Party only for single people. We told
people to bring a top 5 list of reasons why it's better to be single than
to be in a relationship. The reasons were collect and arranged here 
in a Top 10 list for your enjoyment:


10. You get to go to cool Anti-Valentine's Day parties instead of buying
   cards and flowers.

9. Toilet seat stays DOWN. (from a woman)
   The toilet seat stays UP. (from a man)
   (Yes, there was a heated debate on both sides about what is the 
   proper thing to do. The jury is still out.)

8. Morning cotton mouth is OKAY -- and the makers of Scope can just 
   go FUCK OFF.

7. I can watch anything I want -- no channel surfing. (from a woman)
   The remote control is mine, mine, MINE!            (from a man)

6. Your grocery bill will go down by 75%.   (from a woman)
   (My bill would probably go up by 25% ;)

5. No more shoe prints on the bed sheets.
   (She wouldn't offer an explanation, but the word "traction" was
   bandied about.)

4. Rude comments such as "You're looking a little thick in the thighs,
   dear," are mercifully absent from my life!

3. You never have to lie when saying, "I love you."

2. You don't have to sleep in the wet spot if you don't want to.
   (One woman upon hearing this said, "If you're single, why would
    there be a... never mind.")

And the number one reason is:

1. You know the pubic hair in the peanut butter is yours. (you hope)
   (This woman also refused to explain herself.)
