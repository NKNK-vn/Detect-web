This book presents 16 cleverly designed quilts and borders in which the border

She provides lots of suggestions for clever and fast cutting/piecing.


** Children **


TENDER LOVING COVERS
by Toni Phillips and Juanita Simonich

This is a WONDERFUL book of children's quilts with great designs,
mostly pieced.  They are crib/wall quilt size but there is no reason
they could not be incorporated into a large quilt, if you wish.  One
quilt is called Wheels & More Wheels and has a tow truck, fire
engine, ambulance, and police car, so it is not strictly trucks.  In
addition to this, there are the following:  Astronaut, farm, cowboy,
circus, zoo, christmas, a school quilt.


GO WILD WITH QUILTS ($19.95)
by Margaret Rolfe

This book has a lot of North American wildlife -- birds, squirrels, owls, black
bears etc.

It uses straightline piecing methods (no inset pieces) to create realistic
looking animals and birds (cardinal, beaver, racoon etc.)


PATCHWORK QUILTS TO MAKE FOR CHILDREN
by Margaret Rolfe
Sterling Publishing Co. Inc. New York

I can attest to both of these books as great sources for easily
pieced animal blocks.  The GO WILD book was a great hit when we
had it for the book draw at our guild meeting.  It contains 14
North American Animals (racoon, beaver, ducks etc).
----
My favorite for children.  This book hasas a whole zoo, patterns for many
dinosaurs, farm animals, etc.   In my opinion they are more fun than
traditional blocks and make finding naturalistic fabrics fun too.


QUILT A KOALA
by Margaret Rolfe.
Sterling Publishing

Another fun book.  This one has patterns for pieced blocks featuring native
Austrailian birds and animals.


** Color **

COLOR CONFIDENCE FOR QUILTERS ($24.95)
by Jinny Beyer
The Quilt Digest Press, 1992

This is Jinny's color system based on the use of a master palette of fabric
colors that span the spectrum.  By following the instructions in this book, you
create your own master palette that you can use as a tool for color choices
for all of your future quilting projects.  After creating your own color
palette, you will learn how to create countless color schemes just by taking
small sections of the palette, or by rearranging portions of it.


COLOR DESIGN IN PATCHWORK
by Paula Nadelstern
Dover Publications 1991

Explores how color can be used to vary one and the same patchwork
configuration. Depending on the placement of color and the resulting degree of
contrast, different shapes in a pieced pattern are emphasized and visually
linked.  Usually some shapes combine to form the main unit of design, while
remaining ones are interpreted as background.


COLOR AND CLOTH:  THE QUILTMAKER'S ULTIMATE WORKBOOK ($19.95)
by Mary Coyne Penders
The Quilt Digest Press, 1989

This is another good "color confidence" book. Underrated, probably because of
Jinny Beyer's.

STRIPS THAT SIZZLE
by Margaret Miller

My first B&W quilt was made using this book. It is a book primarily meant for
working in color, but I thought the technique worked extraordinarily well for
black and white.  I believe that almost any quilt pattern could be used if you
watch your placement as to shading.


** Design/Designing **


SENSATIONAL SETTINGS
(Over 80 ways to arrange your quilt blocks) ($9.95)

so. I highly recommend it.


ONE-OF-A-KIND QUILTS
(Simple Steps to Individual Quilts) ($16.95)
by Judy Martin
That Patchwork Place 1989

One-of-a-Kind Quilts are structured scrap quilts--everyday quilts that feature
a planned theme or focal area surrounded by blocks made in a variety of
patterns, with the overall design developing as the piece is made.

This book takes you step-by-step through the theme blocks and the background
blocks, covering everything from cutting and construction techniques to the
creative decisions that are made along the way.  Suggestions for completing the
quilts are included.  Master templates and quick-cutting information for the
background blocks are provided toward the end of the book. An excellent book.

SPEED CUTS
by Donna Poster
Chilton for the Creative Machine Arts Series.

In it there are 1200 quilt blocks (although I would say that there
are only 500 designs but each can be constructed in one of three
sizes 10" 12" and 14"). Also, there is a quilt layout section that
shows how many blocks you will need for each size quilt depending on
whether you are putting the blocks together on point, straight set,
with lattice or any combination of these.

Of course, also included is a yardage chart based on the templates to
be used. And the templates themselves are in the back, numbered.
Note:  Blocks are all in black and white.


WALL QUILTS
by Marsha McCloskey
That Patchwork Place, Bothell, WA

beautiful accents of folk art design to many areas throughout the home. It

wall quilts based on traditional pieced designs, several of them with matching
patchwork pillows.  Directed to both beginning and advanced quilters, it

template making, machine-piecing, and hand-quilting to mounting and hanging.


PATCHWORK PATTERNS ($18.95)
Jinny Beyer
EPM Publications, Inc., McLean, VA  1979

This book is written for those who have an interest in using traditional
geometric designs or a desire to create their own original motifs.

It explains in a systematic manner a method of drafting patterns which has, in
large, been put aside, and about which no comprehensive book has been written.
She also explains a few simple drafting techniques which are particularly
useful in making geometric designs.


PATTERN PLAY: CREATING YOUR OWN QUILTS ($24.95)
by Doreen Speckmann
C & T Publishing, Lafayette, California  1993
(Not for beginners)

Introduces you to an easy and fun way to design your own blocks on graph paper,
then put those blocks into interesting quilt designs.  Discusses fabric
selection and the techniques necessary for turning graph paper quilts into real
ones.  Provides scale drawings and photos of some of her favorite quilts,
complete with yardages and size-change options.
------
Down to earth, easy-to-understand method to making your own designs.
Excellent, excellent book.  She writes with a sense of humour and
shows loads of examples to get you thinking.  It's an excellent back
door entrance to a more "creative" side of quilting for those technician
types who don't think they "have" creativity.


BLOCKBUSTER QUILTS
by Margaret Miller

An unusual approach to setting odd blocks (i.e., block of the month,
friendship blocks, good bye blocks, or blocks that are not all quite the same
size) into a quilt top.  More for the advanced piecer.  Very original.


HOW TO DESIGN AND MAKE YOUR OWN QUILTS ($19.95)

** Fast Piecing/Rotary Cutting Techniques **


TIMELESS TREASURES, A Complete Guide to Rotary Cutting
by Nancy Johnson-Srebo
RCW Publishing

Nancy's instructions are clear and concise, and she shows readers how
to cut almost any shape, while using your rotary cutter and ruler.  Also
included are instructions for specific 6", 8", and 10" blocks.
----
I have found the info in this book really helpful.  She goes through how to cut
a number of pieces: trapezoids, parallelograms, hexagrams, octograms, etc.  The
nice thing about the book, too, is that she shows you how to do it for right
handed or left handed cutters. There is also a section in the book for those
who use metric measurements.
----
I find [this book] indispensable.
She gives clear instructions and illustrations to cut any
shape with the rotary cutter.  Both right and left handed illustrations are
given.  In the middle of the book there is a chart for adding on seam
allowances to any shape.  It gives both the English and Metric measurements.
There are also good directions on pressing.

The last part of the book has color photos of blocks and complete directions
for them including cutting, sewing, and pressing.  She includes which direction
to press the seams. (It was great help to me when I was beginning to make
blocks for the first time.)  My only complaint was that there were a couple of
mistakes in the placement of the color photos to the directions.  Some of them
didn't match but were found somewhere else in the book.

BTW, I took the book to a printer and had them put a spiral binding on it so
that it lays flat and stays open when I am using it.

ANGLE ANTICS ($18.95)
by Mary Hickey
That Patchwork Place, 1991

Explores the design potential of a rectangle constructed of two contrasting
triangles (called bias rectangle).  It also provides you with a technique for
constructing this rectangle quickly and accurately.  (Most patterns are star
patterns.)


BACK TO SQUARE ONE ($17.99)
by Nancy J. Martin
That Patchwork Place  1988

Great book featuring Nancy Martin's personal quiltmaking techniques (template-
free approach).
----
She shows how to make what she calls a Square 1, Square
1.5 or Square 2. Square 1 is made of 2 triangles. This is what you need for
Ocean Waves. Square 1.5 is made of one big triangles and 2 little ones. Square
2 is made of 4 little triangles. I am making a huge wall hanging that uses all
of these different squares and it is working wonderfully!


STRIP QUILTING ($14.95)
by Diane Wold
TAB Books, Div. of McGraw Hill 1987

I love this little book.  It's perfect for those who are into piecing and
repiecing (seminole patchwork take off).  It's very easy to follow.

It contains complete instructions, including diagrams, cutting instructions,
and a shopping list, for each of the projects illustrated.  Pointers are given
for modifying projects, for adapting patterns from other sources and for
creating your own designs.

ROTARY ROUNDUP
Judy Hopkins & Nancy Martin
That Patchwork Place

Both books (Rotary Riot below) have about 40 color prints of quilts.  These
quilts are made from traditional block patterns and have instructions for
rotary cutting and quick piecing.  Nancy Martin owns the publishing company
that published these two books.
----
I had Rotary Riot, so I had to buy this one too and I'm not one bit sorry.  I
love to get ideas and inspiration from these books and this one is full of
great colors,beautiful quilts.  Their books are the only ones I use when I need
to make bias binding as it shows the flat cut method.  The only times I tried
to do the continuous circle, it ends up in a mess.


ROTARY RIOT: 40 Fast & Fabulous Quilts ($21.95)
by Judy Hopkins and Nancy J. Martin
That Patchwork Place 1991

The authors of this book take 40 traditional blocks that appeal to many
quiltmakers and adapted their construction to template-free techniques.  Begins
with Nancy's basic review of rotary-cutting techniques and information on
multi-fabric quilts.  The pattern section includes step-by-step directions for
forty favorite quilts, all clearly illustrated and written in a Template-Free
format.  Some of the patterns feature bias squares, some cut with 8" Bias
Square and several use simple strip-piecing techniques.  The patterns are
graded with symbols as to difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Judy
has written a section on Finishing Your Quilt and has included some of the
overall repeat quilting patterns for which she is known.  Also included is
information on crow footing, utility quilting and other tacking techniques.


COLORFUL ANGLES

This book combines the use of applique, traditional blocks, hand
dyed fabrics and the EZ tools (EZ Angle, Companion Angle, Easy Eight, Easy
Hexagon, Speed grids, trapezoids) to create very contemporary designs.  16
projects.  I think this is a good book.

** Foundation Piecing **


EASY MACHINE PAPER PIECING
by Carol Doak
That Patchwork Place

I surrender -- I am a believer.  I attended a workshop last night on
foundation/paper piecing based on this book.  It works, by golly, it works.
What a treat -- and I can turn out such perfectly precise blocks.  It's
wonderful.  If you haven't tried it, you should -- attending a class really
helps because you see how it's done live.


PRECISION PIECED QUILTS USING THE FOUNDATION METHOD
by Jane Hall and Dixie Haywood

I like this book because it offers a good history, well-described theory and
practical examples of piecing on a variety of foundations.  It's well
written and very nicely illustrated with b&w photos, color plates and
instructional line drawings.


** General/Miscellaneous **


SENSATIONAL SCRAP QUILTS
by Darra Duffy Williamson

I like this book, particularly the section on selecting fabrics for scrap
quilts.  I used her idea of making a reference card of all the colors in the
quilt (you take a small piece of each and organize them on a card in a
continuous line from light to dark, ignoring color) and it worked a treat on a
planned scrap quilt I made using about 40 pinks and greys.

QNM did a review and hated it, they said there was nothing new in it. I think
it is well laid out and gives you lots to think about.
----
I learned a lot from this book. First, I discovered D.D. Williamsons theory of
the "Maverick" block in quilts using repeating blocks!  That has helped me to
add more fun and excitement to my quilts.  It also has a section on color use
and drafting patterns.  I find I go back and read this book over and over.
Wonderful!

STRIPS THAT SIZZLE
by Margaret Miller

My first B&W quilt was made using this book. It is a book primarily meant for

watch your placement as to shading.

QUILT ALMANAC 19xx
by Oxmoor House

These are some of my favorites too. The quilts range from very simple
to very difficult. The patterns are good and I enjoy the biographies.

I expect I'll see a QuiltNet quilt featured there!

ESSENTIAL QUILTER, THE
by Barbara Chainey ($29 .95)

A wonderful book.  It is a complete course in the lost art of hand quilting. It
covers everything you might need to know, and the clear photos show you how to
hold the needle, etc. The quilts are all Welsh or English, many are
"whole-cloth" (all-quilted) quilts with beautiful feathers, scrolls, etc. Very
inspirational.

NINE PATCH WONDERS
by Blanche Young and Helen Young Frost
First Star publishers, Tucson, Arizona  1991

Shows what can be done with a nine patch block (interesting color plays,
optical illusions, three dimensional woven effects).

The best of traditional designs as well as some original variations.  Some
quilts are made with all Nine Patch blocks; others combine the pieced blocks
with background blocks.  Others are variations on the Double Nine Patch design,
where pieced blocks are joined with plain squares to form large Nine Patch
blocks.  Combining the 9Patch with other shapes, such as rectangles or
triangles, creates even more variations.

There is a small section on Bow Ties (about a half doz or so pages) in this

staggered.
There are a couple of neat arrangements using color (oh, no, I'm starting

amish colours.  It gives a couple of ideas for borders and sashings as well.

EAST QUILTS WEST ($24.95)
by Kumiko Sodo

It is wonderful!!!  She has many patterns that have  instructions for an
average to advanced quilter.  Her patterns are not,  on the most part, for the
faint of heart.  The best part, is the ideas  which spring forth from her many
designs.  I very, very seldom use a  design, even if given permission - I like
to make my own designe.  Her  book is an inspiration.  I hate to piece curves,
so I have been  appliqueing them down on top of the under piece after turning
under the  edge.  This is how she "pieces" her curves.  The book is rich in
color  and in interestingly narrated.  Her use of color is wonderful.
It is not a cheap book, but I would definitely recommend it.

CONTEMPORARY QUILTS FROM TRADITIONAL DESIGNS ($9.50 used)
by Carolyn L. Mosey
E. P. Dutton Publishers, New York 1988

This book takes a comparative look at the physical changes in the art of
quilting through the years.  While the overall appearance of quilts has
changed, many contemporary quiltmakers keep coming back to traditional
patterns.  The artists represented in this book share their feelings on the
history of quilting, the direction in which it is going and their viewpoints on
several quilt-related topics.

Interesting.  Provides a traditional quilt on one side of the page and a
quilter's contemporary rendition of the same pattern on the other.

by Maude Southwell Wahlman
Studio Books in association with Museum of American Folk Art, New York

This book introduces the art of African-American quiltmaking to the general

of quiltmaking in India, Europe and the Americas and extensive interviews with
quilters.

QUILT STORIES
by Cecilia Macheski, editor
Lexington: The University of Kentucky Press, 1994.

This wonderful book is a collection of poems, short stories, and other prose
works by various authors over the past 150-200 years, all dealing somehow with
quilts and quilting.  The book is divided into 5 sections ("blocks"), each
named for specific quilt blocks: Memory Blocks ("Stories of Remembrance and
Meaning"), Double Wedding Ring ("Stories of Community and Courtship"), Radical
Rose ("Stories of Struggle and Change"), Wheel of Mystery ("Stories of Murder
and Mystery"), and Old Maid's Ramble ("Stories of Age and Wisdom").  The
introduction explains the blocks and the stories a bit, and the editor explains
how quilting provided an important link in literature written by women
(although there are a couple of selections from male authors).


REMEMBER ME; Women and their Friendship Quilts
Lipsett, Linda Otto.
San Francisco, Quilt Digest Press, 1985.
Pb, 140 p, col & b/w ill.

One of the very best quilt books ever Linda Otto Lipsett began with her own
collection of 19th century  friendship quilts. Her book tells the stories of
eight women and eight  quilts made between 1840 and 1895. Many of the stories
are sad stories  of leaving family and comfortable homes in the East to
undertake arduous  journeys in pursuit of new homes in the West. Using letters,
diaries,  interviews and the quilts themselves the author unfolds the everyday
lives of eight real women, following them from youth to old age. Photos  show
the women, their families, their homes, and especially their quilts.  The
excellent color photographs show full quilts, details of blocks,  signatures
and ornaments, and the best close-ups of 19th century fabrics  I have seen.
There are also pictures of other typical friendship quilts,  patterns for three
quilts prepared by Laura Nownes, and complete  references and bibliography.

by Audrey & Douglas Wiss
Sterling/Main Street, NY 1990

This book presents a wide selection of traditional designs for the modern
quilter which have been tested over time.  They are presented in their original
colors and special configurations.  Some date back as far as the 18th century;
others became popular as late as the 1930s.  A few are worked in wool or silk;
most are piecd of plain or printed cottons.  All were made in America and
display a variety of piecing, applique and quilting techniques.
I like this collection.

art is available for MACs in pict form on 3.5" disks.  It is also
available for the IBM or clone, but you must call or write to them and
give them your graphic requirements.

idea for her.

I like this book because it is in black and white and, therefore, easier to
separate values.  There are also a lot of grids that you can copy and play

One woman in my guild made a jacket in it and just raved about

----
This book has a nifty way to make Prairie Points from a strip of fabric.  I've
tried it for trim on a vest and it was very easy.
----
This book has 5 wonderful jacket patterns in it. In the book, she shows how to
do 36 different things to put on a jacket. A few will look very familiar to
most quilters such as a strip of flying geese, though making it without cutting
any triangles may be a new technique. Some such as woven prairie points I had
never seen or heard mentioned before, though I know we have mentioned the
standard prairie points before.

TEXTILE DESIGNS ($65.00)
Susan Meller and Joost Elffers
AQS, Paducah, KY

This book is expensive but worth it if you are a fabric collector.  This book
has some introductory discussion of the the production of types of textiles,
and then the rest is color plates of examples from a collection that has over
5,000,000 "fabrics of the common man" - not the fancy brocades, etc., but
paisleys, calicoes, leaves and foliage, conversationals, block prints, and on,
and on - the kind of stuff that many of us in our quilts.
------
Most of its 461 pages are filled with excellent color pictures  (1,823
illustrations in color) of fabrics we'd all like to have. Color reproduction is
good and the pictures are large so that you can see the pattern detail. My only
serious criticism of the book is that reproductions are not all full-size or
even to the same scale. Page layout seems to have dictated the scale of
reproduction, and on the same page there are illustrations at 50%, 68% and 70%
full size, on other pages 27%, 100%, 120% and 150%. I suppose we should
appreciate the indication of scale included for each sample.

Although the book is expensive, it is not overpriced for a large format
art book with full-color illustrations on good quality paper. It has a
sewn binding and is very sturdily put together.

BLOCKBUSTER QUILTS
by Margaret Miller

An unusual approach to setting odd blocks (i.e., block of the month,
friendship blocks, good bye blocks, or blocks that are not all quite the same
size) into a quilt top.  More for the advanced piecer.  Very original.


CONWAY ALBUM (I'M NOT FROM BALTIMORE) QUILT
by Irma Gail Hatcher

This is a Baltimore style quilt done in a blue design scheme.  Each of
the blocks in her design could be used to make a wonderful quilt of that
block alone.  However, the whole quilt is a stunner.  It's the one that
won first place for Innovative Applique, large quilt AND the Founders
Award at the American International Quilt Show in Houston.

QUILT CLIP ART   ($10.95)

It's a nice little book that has all kinds of sewing-related images, quilt
borders,  the word QUILT in various fonts and stylings, little quilts
flying pigs, thimbles and thread.

The nice part about this publisher is that you can order DISKS of
all the clip art (a necessity if you don't own a scanner!)  The clip
art is available for MACs in pict form on 3.5" disks.  It is also
available for the IBM or clone, but you must call or write to them and
give them your graphic requirements.


COLOR WASH WORKBOOK ($12.95)
by Shirley Liby
Graphics Unlimited, 1993

This book is the result of Liby's creative play and her approach to the process
of color wash through a series of modules that seemed to simplify the whole
idea for her.

I like this book because it is in black and white and, therefore, easier to
separate values.  There are also a lot of grids that you can copy and play
around with your own designs.


COLOR CONFIDENCE FOR QUILTERS ($24.95)
by Jinny Beyer
The Quilt Digest Press, 1992

This is Jinny's color system based on the use of a master palette of fabric
colors that span the spectrum.  By following the instructions in this book, you
create your own master palette that you can use as a tool for color choices
for all of your future quilting projects.  After creating your own color
palette, you will learn how to create countless color schemes just by taking
small sections of the palette, or by rearranging portions of it.

This book definitely helps you to gain confidence in choosing colors for your
projects.


CONTEMPORARY QUILTS FROM TRADITIONAL DESIGNS ($9.50 used)
by Carolyn L. Mosey
E. P. Dutton Publishers, New York 1988

This book takes a comparative look at the physical changes in the art of
quilting through the years.  While the overall appearance of quilts has
changed, many contemporary quiltmakers keep coming back to traditional
patterns.  The artists represented in this book share their feelings on the
history of quilting, the direction in which it is going and their viewpoints on
several quilt-related topics.

Interesting.  Provides a traditional quilt on one side of the page and a
quilter's contemporary rendition of the same pattern on the other.

COLOR AND CLOTH:  THE QUILTMAKER'S ULTIMATE WORKBOOK ($19.95)
by Mary Coyne Penders
The Quilt Digest Press, 1989

This is another good "color confidence" book. Underrated, probably because of
Jinny Beyer's book.


COLOR DESIGN IN PATCHWORK
by Paula Nadelstern
Dover Publications 1991

Explores how color can be used to vary one and the same patchwork
configuration. Depending on the placement of color and the resulting degree of
contrast, different shapes in a pieced pattern are emphasized and visually
linked.  Usually some shapes combine to form the main unit of design, while
remaining ones are interpreted as background.


COLORFUL ANGLES
(Triangles, Diamonds & Hexagons With a Contemporary Look)
by Susan Stein
EZ International  1993

This book combines the use of applique, traditional blocks, hand
dyed fabrics and the EZ tools (EZ Angle, Companion Angle, Easy Eight, Easy
Hexagon, Speed grids, trapezoids) to create very contemporary designs.  16
projects.  I think this is a good book.


CLUES IN THE CALICO; A Guide to Identifying and Dating
Antique Quilts  ($39.95)
by Barbara Brackman.
EPM Publications, 1989.

There are black and white and color pictures and examples and descriptions of
quilts characteristic of different periods. It is one of the best researched
and written quilt books I have encountered, and I have more than 300 books. I
put this in the top ten. Libraries and quilt guilds should have it.

Barbara Brackman also writes articles on quilt history for Quilters Newsletter
magazine. During the past year or so she has been writing about fabrics and how
to date them. I think she has done something on fabrics of the '40s, '50s and
later, but I can't locate the issue at the moment.


EAST QUILTS WEST ($24.95)
by Kumiko Sodo

It is wonderful!!!  She has many patterns that have  instructions for an
average to advanced quilter.  Her patterns are not,  on the most part, for the
faint of heart.  The best part, is the ideas  which spring forth from her many
designs.  I very, very seldom use a  design, even if given permission - I like
to make my own designe.  Her  book is an inspiration.  I hate to piece curves,
so I have been  appliqueing them down on top of the under piece after turning
under the  edge.  This is how she "pieces" her curves.  The book is rich in
color  and in interestingly narrated.  Her use of color is wonderful.
It is not a cheap book, but I would definitely recommend it.

EASY MACHINE PAPER PIECING
by Carol Doak
That Patchwork Place

I surrender -- I am a believer.  I attended a workshop last night on
foundation/paper piecing based on Carol Doak's book "Easy Machine Paper
Piecing".  It works, by golly, it works.  What a treat -- and I can turn
out such perfectly precise blocks.  It's wonderful.  If you haven't tried
it, you should -- attending a class really helps because you see how it's
done live.


ESSENTIAL QUILTER, THE

A wonderful book.  It is a complete course in the lost art of hand quilting. It
covers everything you might need to know, and the clear photos show you how to
hold the needle, etc. The quilts are all Welsh or English, many are
"whole-cloth" (all-quilted) quilts with beautiful feathers, scrolls, etc. Very
inspirational.

display a variety of piecing, applique and quilting techniques.
I like this collection.

JACKET JAZZ ($21.95)
by Judy Murrah
AQS

One woman in
my guild made a jacket in it and just raved about
the book.  She said it was totally lucid, thorough, etc.
----
This book has a nifty way to make Prairie Points from a strip of fabric.  I've
tried it for trim on a vest and it was very easy.
----
This book has 5 wonderful jacket patterns in it. In the book, she shows how to
do 36 different things to put on a jacket. A few will look very familiar to
most quilters such as a strip of flying geese, though making it without cutting
any triangles may be a new technique. Some such as woven prairie points I had
never seen or heard mentioned before, though I know we have mentioned the
standard prairie points before.

I love this one -- it really got me into 30s quilts -- and it's my inspiration,
since I just purchased two 30s tops that need batting, backing,etc.


MORE LAP QUILTING
by Georgia Bonesteel

There is an "Offset Maple Leaf" pattern in this book also complete with
templates. This particular block contains one large maple leaf and three little
maple leaves, all pointing in the same direction.  Personally, I think she does
one odd thing with this block, namely leveling off the bottom of the leaves.
But that's easily fixed.  And as a definite amateur, I probably shouldn't be
questioning the wisdom of quilting teacher.


MEMORY QUILTS:  DELIGHTFUL WAYS TO CAPTURE TODAY FOREVER

NEW SAMPLER QUILT, THE
by Diane Leone

I was flipping through this book yesterday and I found what I thought to be a
great tip. She suggests that early in the day (or whenever you have a minute)
to thread a bunch of betweens with quilting thread. That way when you sit down
to quilt, they will all be ready to go, no stopping to thread and knot!


NIFTY NINE PATCHES
by Carolann M. Palmer

If anyone ever thought ninepatches were humdrum, this should change their mind.
This book also has good instructions on quick rotary cutting and piecing
techniques. My two favorites in this book were the Trellis Garden which looks
like a trellis of interlocking rings with a bright flower garden growing
through it and Morning Dew which I would have called Mideastern Fruit Salad. If
anyone knows the name and maker of the brightly colored fruit fabric used in
this example, I would love to know.


NINE PATCH WONDERS
by Blanche Young and Helen Young Frost
First Star publishers, Tucson, Arizona  1991

Shows what can be done with a nine patch block (interesting color plays,
optical illusions, three dimensional woven effects).

The best of traditional designs as well as some original variations.  Some
quilts are made with all Nine Patch blocks; others combine the pieced blocks
with background blocks.  Others are variations on the Double Nine Patch design,
where pieced blocks are joined with plain squares to form large Nine Patch
blocks.  Combining the 9Patch with other shapes, such as rectangles or
triangles, creates even more variations.


NEW QUILTING AND PATCHWORK DICTIONARY, THE  ($12.95)
by Goldberg, Rhoda Ochser
New York: Crown, 1988.

This should be in EVERY quilter's library.  It has 1,740 illustrations, which
includes all the "classics" of our repetoire plus many charming original
designs (a baby bottle block, international signal flags, a pieced panda,
etc.)All black and white illustrations, but so comprehensive most people won't
even notice!


NEW JERSEY QUILTS 1777 to 1950

ONE-OF-A-KIND QUILTS
(Simple Steps to Individual Quilts) ($16.95)
by Judy Martin
That Patchwork Place 1989

One-of-a-Kind Quilts are structured scrap quilts--everyday quilts that feature
a planned theme or focal area surrounded by blocks made in a variety of
patterns, with the overall design developing as the piece is made.

This book takes you step-by-step through the theme blocks and the background
blocks, covering everything from cutting and construction techniques to the
creative decisions that are made along the way.  Suggestions for completing the
quilts are included.  Master templates and quick-cutting information for the
background blocks are provided toward the end of the book. An excellent book.


PAINLESS BORDERS
by Sally Schneider

This book presents 16 cleverly designed quilts and borders in which the border
is pieced along with the quilt.  My favorite is the twisted ribbon border
which looks like a double sided twisted ribbon cascading along the border.
She provides lots of suggestions for clever and fast cutting/piecing.


PATCHWORK PATTERNS ($18.95)
Jinny Beyer
EPM Publications, Inc., McLean, VA  1979

This book is written for those who have an interest in using traditional
geometric designs or a desire to create their own original motifs.

It explains in a systematic manner a method of drafting patterns which has, in
large, been put aside, and about which no comprehensive book has been written.
She also explains a few simple drafting techniques which are particularly
useful in making geometric designs.


PATCHWORK PLANNER, THE: 350 Original Designs for Traditional Patchwork $27.95
by Birte Hilberg, 1993
David & Charles, Brunel House, Newton, Abbot, Devon.

She did seven years in research and development, using a specially devised
computer program (help from her husband), and presents 350 new designs, using
combinations of these simple blocks.  "This collection provides a rich source
of fresh and original ideas to delight all patchworkers, and all designers who
use geometric patterns."

I found it very interesting and expect to read it again and again, and will use
it when attempting to design quilts of my own using Adobe Illustrator.  She has
come up with figures, circular designs, lots in color, lots in black and white
that could be colored in wonderful ways. She presents her "Tile Library," which
could easily be duplicated on the computer (so you could manipulate your own).
The blocks/tiles are simple.  She hand pieces, but most can be machine pieced
easily.

Lots of ideas for developing one's own original designs.


PATTERN PLAY: CREATING YOUR OWN QUILTS ($24.95)

complete with yardages and size-change options.
------
Down to earth, easy-to-understand method to making your own designs.
Excellent, excellent book.  She writes with a sense of humour and
shows loads of examples to get you thinking.  It's an excellent back
door entrance to a more "creative" side of quilting for those technician
types who don't think they "have" creativity.

PIECES OF THE PAST
by Nancy Martin
That Patchwork Place


PLAIN AND SIMPLE
by Sue Bender

She tells of her fascination with the vibrant colors and stunning geometric
simplicity of the Amish quilts. The quilts "spoke directly to me...they went
straight to my heart."  I highly recommend the book.  It was after reading her
book that I started learning how to quilt.


PATCHWORK QUILTS TO MAKE FOR CHILDREN
by Margaret Rolfe
Sterling Publishing Co. Inc. New York

I can attest to both of these books as great sources for easily
pieced animal blocks.  The GO WILD book was a great hit when we
had it for the book draw at our guild meeting.  It contains 14
North American Animals (racoon, beaver, ducks etc).
----
My favorite for children.  This book hasas a whole zoo, patterns for many
dinosaurs, farm animals, etc.   In my opinion they are more fun than
traditional blocks and make finding naturalistic fabrics fun too.

other interesting patterns in it for large print fabrics.


QUILT ALMANAC 19xx
by Oxmoor House

These are some of my favorites too. The quilts range from very simple
to very difficult. The patterns are good and I enjoy the biographies.
There's a chapter each year on group quilts or guild quilts and someday
I expect I'll see a QuiltNet quilt featured there!


QUILT STORIES
by Cecilia Macheski, editor
Lexington: The University of Kentucky Press, 1994.

This wonderful book is a collection of poems, short stories, and other prose
works by various authors over the past 150-200 years, all dealing somehow with
quilts and quilting.  The book is divided into 5 sections ("blocks"), each
named for specific quilt blocks: Memory Blocks ("Stories of Remembrance and
Meaning"), Double Wedding Ring ("Stories of Community and Courtship"), Radical
Rose ("Stories of Struggle and Change"), Wheel of Mystery ("Stories of Murder
and Mystery"), and Old Maid's Ramble ("Stories of Age and Wisdom").  The

can be arranged with different colors at least 10 times. I've yet to read the
book in detail, but she does this with many patterns and it looks really neat!

The Complete Guide to Quiltmaking

Great book.

Includes patterns that beginning quiltmakers can complete successfully, as well
as designs an experienced quiltmaker will enjoy working with.  Popular and
traditional patterns--and all the instructions for the techniques required to
make them.

The patterns are arranged in a progressive sequence, incorporating new designs
and utilizing more difficult techniques as you move from the simpler patterns

with careful work all can be completed by the quiltmaker who begins with the
simpler patterns, moving onward as experience warrants.

ROTARY ROUNDUP
Judy Hopkins & Nancy Martin
That Patchwork Place

Both books (Rotary Riot below) have about 40 color prints of quilts.  These
quilts are made from traditional block patterns and have instructions for
rotary cutting and quick piecing.  Nancy Martin owns the publishing company
that published these two books.
----
I had Rotary Riot, so I had to buy this one too and I'm not one bit sorry.  I
love to get ideas and inspiration from these books and this one is full of
great colors,beautiful quilts.  Their books are the only ones I use when I need
to make bias binding as it shows the flat cut method.  The only times I tried
to do the continuous circle, it ends up in a mess.


ROTARY RIOT: 40 Fast & Fabulous Quilts ($21.95)
by Judy Hopkins and Nancy J. Martin
That Patchwork Place 1991

The authors of this book take 40 traditional blocks that appeal to many
quiltmakers and adapted their construction to template-free techniques.  Begins
with Nancy's basic review of rotary-cutting techniques and information on
multi-fabric quilts.  The pattern section includes step-by-step directions for
forty favorite quilts, all clearly illustrated and written in a Template-Free
format.  Some of the patterns feature bias squares, some cut with 8" Bias
Square and several use simple strip-piecing techniques.  The patterns are
graded with symbols as to difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced).  Judy
has written a section on Finishing Your Quilt and has included some of the
overall repeat quilting patterns for which she is known.  Also included is
information on crow footing, utility quilting and other tacking techniques.


REMEMBER ME; Women and their Friendship Quilts
Lipsett, Linda Otto.
San Francisco, Quilt Digest Press, 1985.
Pb, 140 p, col & b/w ill.

One of the very best quilt books ever Linda Otto Lipsett began with her own
collection of 19th century  friendship quilts. Her book tells the stories of
eight women and eight  quilts made between 1840 and 1895. Many of the stories
are sad stories  of leaving family and comfortable homes in the East to
undertake arduous  journeys in pursuit of new homes in the West. Using letters,
diaries,  interviews and the quilts themselves the author unfolds the everyday
lives of eight real women, following them from youth to old age. Photos  show
the women, their families, their homes, and especially their quilts.  The
excellent color photographs show full quilts, details of blocks,  signatures
and ornaments, and the best close-ups of 19th century fabrics  I have seen.
There are also pictures of other typical friendship quilts,  patterns for three
quilts prepared by Laura Nownes, and complete  references and bibliography.

by Maude Southwell Wahlman
Studio Books in association with Museum of American Folk Art, New York

This book introduces the art of African-American quiltmaking to the general
public.  Her thesis is that most African-American quiltmaking derives its
aesthetic from various African traditionsk, both technological and ideological.


Provides an abundance of detailed information on African textiles, the history
of quiltmaking in India, Europe and the Americas and extensive interviews with
quilters.

Excellent.

SPEED CUTS
by Donna Poster
Chilton for the Creative Machine Arts Series.

In it there are 1200 quilt blocks (although I would say that there
are only 500 designs but each can be constructed in one of three
sizes 10" 12" and 14"). Also, there is a quilt layout section that
shows how many blocks you will need for each size quilt depending on
whether you are putting the blocks together on point, straight set,
with lattice or any combination of these.

Of course, also included is a yardage chart based on the templates to
be used. And the templates themselves are in the back, numbered.

Note:  Blocks are all in black and white.


STRIPS THAT SIZZLE
by Margaret Miller

My first B&W quilt was made using this book. It is a book primarily meant for
working in color, but I thought the technique worked extraordinarily well for
black and white.  I believe that almost any quilt pattern could be used if you
watch your placement as to shading.


SMALL TALK

SETS & BORDERS
by Marston & Cunningham, AQS

I have had this book a long time.  It has lots of good photos, border ideas and
charts for planning them.  I have found it inspirational and helpful.
----
Wonderful color photos of quilts with comments about their settings/borders.
Also, a good look at how different borders can change a quilt.  Finally,
patterns and ideas for a variety of borders. Really stimulatd my thinking and
I'm looking forward to trying some of the ideas.
----
This'un shows lots'n'lots of possible ways to set blocks, and also a goodly
number of border possibilities.  There are several cases where the book shows
essentially the same blocks in more than one quilt, but the borders and/or
setting vary.  It's one I use as an imagination trigger when I need to decide
on a border.


SENSATIONAL SCRAP QUILTS
by Darra Duffy Williamson

I like this book, particularly the section on selecting fabrics for scrap
quilts.  I used her idea of making a reference card of all the colors in the
quilt (you take a small piece of each and organize them on a card in a
continuous line from light to dark, ignoring color) and it worked a treat on a
planned scrap quilt I made using about 40 pinks and greys.

QNM did a review and hated it, they said there was nothing new in it. I think
it is well laid out and gives you lots to think about.
----
I learned a lot from this book. First, I discovered D.D. Williamsons theory of
the "Maverick" block in quilts using repeating blocks!  That has helped me to
add more fun and excitement to my quilts.  It also has a section on color use
and drafting patterns.  I find I go back and read this book over and over.
Wonderful!


STAR QUILTS ($20)
by Mary Elizabeth Johnson
Clarkson Potter Publishers

Good collection of star quilts.
----
I like this book. She is well organized and gives you some good photos and
directions. Haven't tried anything from it yet. (I got it from a closeout
catalog for under $10. It's a good deal at that price. Not sure if I'd pay
$20 for it though.)


TEXTILE DESIGNS ($65.00)
Susan Meller and Joost Elffers
AQS, Paducah, KY

This book is expensive but worth it if you are a fabric collector.  This book
has some introductory discussion of the the production of types of textiles,
and then the rest is color plates of examples from a collection that has over
5,000,000 "fabrics of the common man" - not the fancy brocades, etc., but
paisleys, calicoes, leaves and foliage, conversationals, block prints, and on,
and on - the kind of stuff that many of us in our quilts.
------
Most of its 461 pages are filled with excellent color pictures  (1,823
illustrations in color) of fabrics we'd all like to have. Color reproduction is
good and the pictures are large so that you can see the pattern detail. My only
serious criticism of the book is that reproductions are not all full-size or
even to the same scale. Page layout seems to have dictated the scale of
reproduction, and on the same page there are illustrations at 50%, 68% and 70%
full size, on other pages 27%, 100%, 120% and 150%. I suppose we should
appreciate the indication of scale included for each sample.

Although the book is expensive, it is not overpriced for a large format
art book with full-color illustrations on good quality paper. It has a
sewn binding and is very sturdily put together.

TENDER LOVING COVERS
by Toni Phillips and Juanita Simonich

This is a WONDERFUL book of children's quilts with great designs,
mostly pieced.  They are crib/wall quilt size but there is no reason
they could not be incorporated into a large quilt, if you wish.  One
quilt is called Wheels & More Wheels and has a tow truck, fire
engine, ambulance, and police car, so it is not strictly trucks.  In
addition to this, there are the following:  Astronaut, farm, cowboy,
circus, zoo, christmas, a school quilt.

recommend this book.

TIMELESS TREASURES, A Complete Guide to Rotary Cutting
by Nancy Johnson-Srebo
RCW Publishing

Nancy's instructions are clear and concise, and she shows readers how
to cut almost any shape, while using your rotary cutter and ruler.  Also
included are instructions for specific 6", 8", and 10" blocks.
----
I have found the info in this book really helpful.  She goes through how to cut
a number of pieces: trapezoids, parallelograms, hexagrams, octograms, etc.  The
nice thing about the book, too, is that she shows you how to do it for right
handed or left handed cutters. There is also a section in the book for those
who use metric measurements.
----
I find [this book] indispensable.  She gives clear instructions and
illustrations to cut any shape with the rotary cutter.  Both right and left
handed illustrations are given.  In the middle of the book there is a chart
for adding on seam allowances to any shape.  It gives both the English and
Metric measurements.  There are also good directions on pressing.

The last part of the book has color photos of blocks and complete directions
for them including cutting, sewing, and pressing.  She includes which direction
to press the seams. (It was great help to me when I was beginning to make
blocks for the first time.)  My only complaint was that there were a couple of
mistakes in the placement of the color photos to the directions.  Some of them
didn't match but were found somewhere else in the book.

BTW, I took the book to a printer and had them put a spiral binding on it so
that it lays flat and stays open when I am using it.
