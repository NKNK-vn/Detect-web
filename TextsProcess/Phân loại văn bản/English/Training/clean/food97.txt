HERB :          DAMIANA
BOTANICAL NAME: Turnera diffusa L.
SYNONYMS      : Mexican Damiana
LOCALES FOUND : Texas & Mexican Deserts

The effects of Damiana  are to stimulate the genito-
urinary tract, acting as a mild aphrodisiac and also
produces a euphoria like that produced by the THC in
Marijuana for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
 
CAUTION : Excessive long term use of this herb may be
toxic to the liver (in a way similar as alchol can)
 
Damiana can be prepared as a tea, using two heaping
tablespoons of dried leaf and letting it seep for just
under 5 minutes. [Adding a tablespoon of Catnip to this
can increase the euphoria effect but may detract from
the Aphrodisiac stimulation].
   It can also be prepared as a liquer, by mixing it
with Vodka (1 ounce leaf to 1 pint vodka for 5 days
before consuming), but may have a mild purgative result
in some people.
   You can also place it within a brownie mix, as if
marijuana, at about the same levels. This cuts the
flavor, but not the effects as far as is known.
   It can also be added to a standard meade recipe,
about 1 ounce per gallon, at the start of fermentation
process.
 
   Damiana is useful in magical work in that it aids in
the breaking down of the natural mental barriers and
inhibitors, if not used in excess, and preferably not by
someone working on the opening of a gateway/portal. It
can be highly useful in tantra magics and in such activities
as Astral travel, deep meditation and spirit quests.
   Damiana is LEGAL at present in the US, but like most
herbs that have mind-influencing affects there have been
attempts at legislation to prevent its sale in some states
but so far it should not be a problem. Damiana may also
be useful in small quantities for stomache ailments,
and pain relief in mixes with other herbs.
