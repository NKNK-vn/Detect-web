Ingredients:
1/2 cup lentils               1/4 onion
3 or 4 cloves of garlic       A pad of butter or olive oil
crushed  (onions diced by
the way)
A double handful of spinach   1/2 small eggplant diced.
A dash of salt                Feta to taste.


Instructions:
1. Cover the lentils with water and ring to a boil.
2. When the lentils boil, lower heat to a simmer.
3. Add the salt and cover the lentils, simmering for about
25 min.
4. While the lentils are cooking, dice the onions and
eggplant and crush the garlic.  Also stem the spinach.
5. Put the butter or olive oil in a frying pan or wok.
6. With about ten min. left to go on the lentils, begin to
sauté the onions and garlic.
7. Add the spinach after the garlic and onions have begun to
sizzle.
8. When the spinach has cooked down a bit, add the eggplant
and continue stirring.
9. Drain the lentils and serve on a plate with the spinach
and eggplant. Crumble the feta on top to taste.
10. Serve with red wine. (I tried white the other day.  I
haven't tried red, but it seems to go better with lentil
things and spinach anyway.)

Comments:
Here's a quick recipe I made up (sort of) last week.  It's a
whole meal.
