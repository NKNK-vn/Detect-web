Comments:
I save the ends of bread loaf(we use an iron rich kids bread
that is suppose to be good for kids and since even my hubby
wont eat wheat bread).  Anyway I save the ends in my freezer
when i have accumulated enough i make this bread cake recipe
which is very good!
This is a delicious recipe and great use for leftovers.
Variations include using coconut instead of cinnamon or 1/4
c. cocoa powder or T. vanilla ...all in place of cinnamon.
