                   EXPLANATION OF WORLD HERITAGE LIST

      The World Heritage List was established under terms of the
Convention Concerning the Protection of World Culture and Natural
Heritage adopted in November, 1972 at the 17th General Conference
of UNESCO.

      The Convention states that a World Heritage Committee "will
establish, keep up-to-date and publish" a World Heritage List of
cultural and natural properties, submitted by the States and
considered to be of outstanding universal value.

      One of the main responsibilities of this Committee is to
provide technical co-operation under the World Heritage Fund for
the safeguarding of World Heritage Sites to States Parties whose
resources are insufficient.

      States Parties can request international assistance under
the Fund for expert missions, training of specialized staff, and
supply of equipment when appropriate; they can also apply for
long-term loans and, in special cases, non-repayable grants.
Requests must concern work necessary for the preservation of
cultural or natural sites included in the World Heritage List or
assistance to national or regional training centres.

      Emergency assistance is also available under the Fund in the
case of properties severely damaged by specific natural or
man-made disasters or threatened with imminent destruction.
      As of the end of 1990, 115 Member States had ratified the
Convention, the United States being the first to do so. As of
January 1992, the number of sites on the World Heritage List
stands at 358. The Committee named 12 sites in 1978, 45 in 1979,
28 in 1980, 26 in 1981, 24 in 1982, 29 in 1983, 23 in 1984, 31 in
1985, 27 in 1986, 41 in 1987, 27 in 1988, 7 in 1989, 17 in 1990,
and 23 in 1991.

                               * * * * * 

*Small discrepancies in numbers may be due to different methods
of numbering sites, and overlapping of sites into two countries.
