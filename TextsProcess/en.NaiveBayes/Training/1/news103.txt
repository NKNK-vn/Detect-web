  Most of you know about the PHRACK trial and Craig Neidorf, the
  publisher of PHRACK. Craig put his neck on the line to provide
  timely, interesting, and helpful information to the phreak/hacker
  community. The government decided to put a stop to that flow of
  information so last summer they arrested Craig for publishing a
  PHRACK article on Bell South's Emergency 911 system, an article
  which contained a document which was illegally downloaded from Bell
  South's computer system.

  The government's case fell apart after it was revealed that the
  document, originally valued at $79,449 by Bell South, was
  obtainable by dialing an 800 number and paying $13. This, and the
  fact that Neidorf was not the one who accessed Bell South's
  computer, caused the government to drop the charges and set Craig
  Neidorf free.

  Good news, right? Well it is and it isn't. While the government
  lost its case, Craig Neidorf will no longer be publishing PHRACK,
  so the government still wins. The fact is that although Craig won
  in court, he must still pay his own attorney's fees. His original
  bill reached over $200,000! The law firm that he had retained found
  ways to reduce $100,000 off of that amount, but Craig and his
  family have still paid $35,000 to one firm, $8,000 to another, and
  have roughly $65,000 left to pay off. THIS IS AFTER "WINNING" IN
  COURT!

  No, he cannot sue the government for this money. He has to pay it
  himself. A lot of people seem to think that the Electronic Frontier
  Foundation (EFF) is going to help him with his legal bills. No way.
  The EFF does not want to be perceived as a "hacker defense fund" so
  they are trying to distance themselves from the case. Their only
  help in the matter was to pay for court motions filed by the EFF's
  law firm on Neidorf's behalf concerning the First Ammendment. THE
  EFF HAS NO PLANS AT THIS TIME TO HELP PAY NEIDORF'S ATTORNEY FEES.

  What this means is that Craig Neidorf, after being harrassed and
  arrested by the government for PUBLISHING A MAGAZINE, will shut his
  magazine down and pay approximately $100,000 in attorney fees EVEN
  THOUGH HE WON HIS COURT BATTLE.

  If you're as outraged by this as I am, I want you to know that you
  can do something about it. You can show Neidorf how much you valued
  PHRACK and how outraged you are about what happened to him by
  sending money to the Neidorf Defense Fund. Every cent that you send
  will be used to defray his attorney fees. The address is:
