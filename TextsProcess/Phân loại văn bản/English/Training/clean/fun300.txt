Copyright Royalty Tribunal, at the end of the 1-year period beginning

authorized by subsection (c) are in effect so as to provide permission to 
use a quantity of musical works not substantially smaller than the 
quantity of such works performed on coin-operated phonorecord players 
during the 1-year period ending on the effective date of that Act.  If the 
Copyright Royalty Tribunal determines that such negotiated licenses are 
not so in effect, the Tribunal shall, upon making the determination,

publication, section 116 shall apply with respect to musical works that 
are not the subject of such negotiated licenses.

works to which this section applies and any operators of coin-operated

royalty payments.

time as may be specified by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal by

(c), shall be given effect in lieu of any otherwise applicable 
determination by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.

the Chairman of the copyright Royalty Tribunal has not received 
notice, from copyright owners and operators of coin-operated

operators to commence negotiations authorized by subsection (c), the 
Chairman shall announce the date and location of such meeting.  Such

such Act.

"(f) Copyright Royalty Tribunal To Suspend Various 
Activities.--The Copyright Royalty Tribunal shall not conduct any rate-
making activity with respect to coin-operated phonorecord players 
unless, at any time more than one year after the effective date of the 
Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, the negotiated licenses 
adopted by the parties under this section do not provide permission to 
use a quantity of such works performed on coin-operated phonorecord 
players during the one-year period ending on the effective date of such 
Act.

"(g) Transition Provisions; Retention of Copyright Royalty 
Tribunal Jurisdiction.--Until such time as licensing provisions are

performance of nondramatic musical works by means of coin-operated 
phonorecord players, which is in effect on the day before the effective 
date of the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, shall remain 
in force.  If a negotiated license authorized by this section comes into 
force so as to supersede previous determinations of the Copyright 
Royalty Tribunal, as provided in subsection (d), but thereafter is 
terminated or expires and is not replaced by another licensing 
agreement, then section 116 shall be effective with respect to musical 
works that were the subject of such terminated or expired licenses.".
