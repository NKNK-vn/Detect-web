        He tried the lock a second time.  Of course, it refused 
to open.  Each time he glanced her way she was grinning.  
        She refused to speak to him.  Instead she just took his 
shoulders and laid him down in her old space on the bed.  She 
tied his hands to the two corners of the headboard,  and with a 
little more difficulty, tied his knees apart with the board at 
the foot of the bed.  
        Giving him a long lingering kiss, she blindfolded him and 
left the room.
        As she had tied him, he had become hard again.  He was 
pleased to have thought up the blindfold, though more pleased to 
have used it than to have felt it's disorienting effects.  
        Her smell was still strong in the room.  As he noticed 
it, he could feel himself becoming harder.  He was glad the bet 
had limited her winnings.  He knew he couldn't have stood the 
amount of teasing that she had evidently taken in stride.
        He could hear the shower running.  It went on for some 
minutes.  He could smell her scent still on his lips.  It was 
very tantilizing to be aroused (physically), have her smell on 
himself and not to be able to touch himself.  
        The shower stopped.  He heard her enter.  A moment later 
he felt a hot wash rag wrapped around his cock and balls as well
his lower stomach.
