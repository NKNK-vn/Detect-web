                          ________________________


  .  As you are surveying the dark and misty swamp you come across what
     appears to be a small cave.  You light  a  torch  and  enter.  You
     have  walked  several  hundred feet when you stumble into a bright
     blue portal.  .  .  With a  sudden  burst  of  light  and  a  loud
     explosion you are swept into . . . DRAGONFIRE . . .  Press Any Key
     if You Dare."

  .  You have programmed your personal computer to dial into
     Dragonfire, a computer bulletin board in Gainesville,  Texas.  But
     before you get any information, Dragonfire demands your name, home
     city  and phone number.  So,  for tonight's tour of the electronic
     wilderness you become Montana Wildhack of San Francisco.

  .  Dragonfire, Sherwood Forest (sic), Forbidden Zone,
     Blottoland,  Plovernet,  The Vault, Shadowland, PHBI and scores of
     other computer bulletin boards are hangouts of a new generation of
     vandals. These precocious teenagers use their electronic skills to
     play hide-and-seek with computer and  telephone  security  forces.
     Many  computer  bulletin  boards  are  perfectly legitimate:  they
     resemble electronic  versions  of  the  familiar  cork  boards  in
     supermarkets and school corridors,  listing services and providing
     information someone out there is bound to find  useful.  But  this
     is  a walk on the wild side,  a trip into the world of underground
     bulletin  boards  dedicated  to  encouraging  --  and  making   --
     mischief.

  .  The phone number for these boards are as closely guarded as a
     psychiatrist's home telephone number.  Some numbers are posted on
     underground  boards;  others  are exchanged over the telephone.  A
     friendly hacker provided Dragonfire's number.  Hook up and you see
     a broad choice of topics offered. For Phone Phreaks -- who delight
     in  stealing  service  from  AT&T  and  other  phone  networks   .
     Phreakenstein's Lair is a potpourri of phone numbers, access codes
     and  technical information.  For computer hackers -- who dial into
     other people's computers -- Ranger's Lodge is chock-full of  phone
     numbers  and  passwords  for government,  university and corporate
     computers.  Moving through Dragonfire's offerings,  you  can  only
     marvel  at  how conversant these teen-agers are with the technical
     esoterica of today's electronic age.  Obviously they have spent  a
     great  deal  of time studying computers,  though their grammar and
     spelling indicate they haven't been diligent  in  other  subjects.
     You are constantly reminded of how young they are.

  .  "Well it's that time of year again. School is back in session
     so  let's get those high school computer phone numbers rolling in.
     Time to get straight A's,  have perfect  attendance  (except  when
     you've been up all night hacking school passwords), and messing up
     you worst teacher's paycheck."

  .  Forbidden Zone, in Detroit, is offering ammunition for hacker
     civil war -- tips on  crashing  the  most  popular  bulletin-board
     software.  There  also are plans for building black,  red and blue
     boxes to mimic operator tones and get free phone service.  And  he
     re  are  the  details for "the safest and best way to make and use
     nitroglycerine," compliments of Doctor Hex, who says he got it
     "from my chemistry teacher."

  .  Flip through the "pages." You have to wonder if this
     information  is accurate.  Can this really be the phone number and
     password for Taco Bell's computer?  Do these kids really have  the
     dial-up numbers for dozens of university computers? The temptation
     is  too much.  You sign off and have your computer dial the number
     for the Yale computer.  Bingo -- the words Yale University  appear
     on your screen.  You enter the password.  A menu appears. You hang
     up in a sweat. You are now a hacker.

  .  Punch in another number and your modem zips off the touch
     tones. Here comes the tedious side of all of this. Bulletin boards
     are popular. No vacancy in Bates Motel (named for Anthony Perkin's
     creepy motel in the movie "Psycho"); the line is busy.  So are 221
     B.  Baker Street, PHBI, Shadowland and The Vault,  Caesar's Palace
     rings  and  connects.  This is different breed of board.  Caesar's
     Palace is a combination Phreak board and computer store in  Miami.
     This  is  the  place to learn ways to mess up a department store's
     anti-shoplifting system,  or make free calls  on  telephones  with
     locks  on  the  dial.  Pure  capitalism  accompanies such anarchy,
     Caesar's Palace is offering good deals on disc  drives,  software,
     computers  and  all  sorts of hardware.  Orders are placed through
     electronic mail messages.

  .  'Tele-Trial': Bored by Caesar's Palace, you enter the number
     for Blottoland,  the board operated by one of  the  nation's  most
     notorious computer phreaks -- King Blotto.  This one has been busy
     all night, but it's now pretty late in Cleveland.  The phone rings
     and you connect.  To get past the blank screen, type the secondary
     password "S-L-I-M-E." King Blotto obliges,  listing his rules:  he
     must have your real name,  phone number,  address,  occupation and
     interests. He will call and disclose the primary password, "if you
     belong on this board." If admitted, do not reveal the phone number
     or  the  secondary password,  lest you face "tele-trial," the King
     warns as he dismisses  you  by  hanging  up.  You  expected  heavy
     security,  but this teenager's security is,  as they say, awesome.
     Computers at the Defense Department and hundreds of businesses let
     you know when you've reached them.  Here you need a password  just
     to find out what system answered the phone.  Then King Blotto asks
     questions -- and hangs up.  Professional computer-security experts
     could learn something from this kid.  He knows that ever since the
     414 computer hackers were arrested in August 1982, law-enforcement
     officers  have  been  searching  for  leads  on  computer bulletin
     boards.

  .  "Do you have any ties to or connections with any law
     enforcement  agency  or  any  agency which would inform such a law
     enforcement agency of this bulletin board?"

  .  Such is the welcoming message from Plovernet, a Florida board
     known  for  its great hacker/phreak files.  There amid a string of
     valid VISA and MasterCard numbers are  dozens  of  computer  phone
     numbers  and  passwords.  Here you also learn what Blotto means by
     tele-trial.  "As some of you may or may not know, a session of the
     conference  court was held and the Wizard was found guilty of some
     miscellaneous  charges,  and  sentenced  to  four  months  without
     bulletin  boards."  If  Wizard  calls,  system operators like King
     Blotto disconnect him. Paging through bulletin boards is a test of
     your patience. Each board has different commands.  Few are easy to
     follow,  leaving you to hunt and peck your way around.  So far you
     haven't had the nerve  to  type  "C,"  which  summons  the  system
     operator for a live, computer-to-computer conversation.  The time,
     however,  however  has  come for you to ask a few questions of the
     "sysop." You dial a computer in Boston.  It answers and you  begin
     working your way throughout the menus. You scan a handful of dial-
     up  numbers,  including one for Arpanet,  the Defense Department's
     research computer.  Bravely tap C and in seconds the screen blanks
     and your cursor dances across the screen.

  .  Hello . . . What kind of computer do you have?

  .  Contact. The sysop is here. You exchange amenities and get
     "talking." How much hacking does he do?  Not much, too busy. Is he
     afraid of being busted,  having his computer confiscated like  the
     Los  Angeles  man  facing  criminal  changes  because his computer
     bulletin board contained a  stolen  telephone-credit-card  number?
     "Hmmmm  .  .  .  No,"  he  replies.  Finally,  he asks the dreaded
     question:  "How old are  you?"  "How  old  are  YOU,"  you  reply,
     stalling.  "15,"  he  types.  Once you confess and he knows you're
     old enough to be his father,  the conversation gets very  serious.
     You fear each new question;  he probably thinks you're a cop.  But
     all he wants to know  is  your  choice  for  president.  The  chat
     continues,  until  he  asks,  "What  time  is it there?" Just past
     midnight, you reply. Expletive. "it's 3:08 here," Sysop types.  "I
     must be going to sleep.  I've got  school  tomorrow."  The  cursor
     dances "*********** Thank you for Calling." The screen goes blank.

                                 Epilog:

  .  A few weeks after this reporter submitted this article to
     Newsweek,  he found that his credit had been altered, his drivers'
     licence revoked,  and EVEN HIS Social  Security  records  changed!
     Just in case you all might like to construe this as a 'Victimless'
     crime.  The  next  time  a  computer fouls up your billing on some
     matter, and COSTS YOU, think about it!
                     _______________________________

  .  This the follow-up to the previous article concerning the
     Newsweek reporter.  It spells out SOME of the REAL dangers to  ALL
                   of us, due to this type of activity!

                     _______________________________
                        The REVENGE of the Hackers
                     _______________________________

  .  In the mischievous fraternity of computer hackers, few things
     are  prized  more  than  the  veil  of  secrecy.  As  NEWSWEEK San
     Francisco correspondent Richard Sandza found out after  writing  a
     story on the electronic underground's (DISPATCHES,  Nov.  12, 198\
     ability  to  exact  revenge  can  be  unnerving.  Also  severe....
     Sandza's report:

  .  "Conference!" someone yelled as I put the phone to my ear.
     Then came a mind-piercing "beep," and suddenly my  kitchen  seemed
     full  of  hyperactive  15-year-olds.  "You  the  guy who wrote the
     article in NEWSWEEK?" someone shouted from the depths  of  static,
     and  giggles.  "We're  going disconnect your phone," one shrieked.
     "We're going to blow up your house," called another. I hung up.

  .  Some irate readers write letters to the editor. A few call
     their  lawyers.   Hackers,  however,  use  the  computer  and  the
     telephone, and for more than simple comment. Within days, computer
     "bulletin  boards"  around the country were lit up with attacks on
     NEWSWEEK's "Montana Wildhack" (a name I took from a Kurt  Vonnegut
     character),  questioning  everything  from  my manhood to my prose
     style.  "Until we get real good revenge," said  one  message  from
     Unknown  Warrior,  "I  would like to suggest that everyone with an
     auto-l modem call Montana Butthack then hang up when he  answers."
     Since  then  the  hackers  of America have called my home at least
     2000 times.  My harshest  critics  communicate  on  Dragonfire,  a
     Gainesville,  Texas,  bulletin  board  where I am on teletrial,  a
     video-lynching in which a computer user with grievance  dials  the
     board  and  presses  charges  against  the offending party.  Other
     hackers  --  including  the  defendant  --post   concurrences   or
     rebuttals.  Despite  the  mealtime interruptions,  all this was at
     most a minor nuisance; some was amusing, even fun.

  .  FRAUD: The fun stopped with a call from a man who identified
     himself only as Joe.  "I'm calling to warn you," he said.  When  I
     barked back, he said, "Wait, I'm on your side.  Someone has broken
     into TRW and obtained a list of all your credit-card numbers, your
     home address,  social-security  number  and  wife's  name  and  is
     posting  it  on  bulletin boards around the country." He named the
     charge cards in my wallet.

  .  Credit-card numbers are a very hot commodity among some
     hackers.  To get one from a computer system and  post  it  is  the
     hacker  equivalent  of  making the team.  After hearing from Joe I
     visited the local office of the TRW credit bureau and got  a  copy
     of my credit record.  Sure enough, it showed a Nov.  13 inquiry by
     the Lenox (Mass.) Savings Bank,  an  institution  with  no  reason
     whatever  to  ask  about me.  Clearly some hacker had used Lenox's
     password to the TRW computers to get to my  files  (the  bank  has
     since changed the password).

  .  It wasn't long before I found out what was being done with my
     credit-card numbers,  thanks to another friendly hacker who tipped
     me to Pirate 80,  a bulletin board in Charleston,  W.Va.,  where I
     found  this:  "I'm  sure you guys have heard about Richard Stza or
     Montana Wildhack.  He's the guy who wrote the obscene story  about
     phreaking  in NewsWeek Well,  my friend did a credit card check on
     TRW . . . try this number, it' a VISA . .  .  Please nail this guy
     bad . . . Captain Quieg.

  .  Captain Quieg may himself be nailed. He has violated the
     Credit  Card  Fraud Act of 1984 signed by President Reagan on Oct.
     12.  The law provides a $10,000 fine and up to  a  15-year  prison
     term  for  "trafficking" in illegally obtained credit-card account
     numbers.  His "friend" has committed  a  felony  violation  of  the
     California  computer-crime  law.  TRW  spokeswoman Delia Fernandex
     said that TRW would "be more than  happy  to  prosecute"  both  of
     them.

  .  TRW has good reason for concern. Its computers contain the
     credit  histories  of  120  million people.  Last year TRW sold 50
     million credit  reports  on  their  customers.  But  these  highly
     confidential   personal   records   are  so  poorly  guarded  that
     computerized  teenagers  can  ransack   the   files   and   depart
     undetected. TRW passwords -- unlike many others -- often print out
     when  entered by TRW's customers.  Hackers then look for discarded
     printouts.  A good source:  the  trash  of  banks  and  automobile
     dealerships,  which  routinely do credit checks.  "Everybody hacks
     TRW," says Cleveland hacker King Blotto,  whose bulletin board has
     security  system the Pentagon would envy.  "It's the easiest." For
     her her part,  Fernandez insists that TRW "does everything it  can
     to keep the system secure.

  .  In my case, however, that was not enough. My credit limits
     would hardly support big-time fraud,  but victimization takes many
     forms. Another hacker said it was likely that merchandise would be
     ordered in my name and shipped to me -- just to harass me.  I used
     to  use  credit-card  numbers  against someone I didn't like," the
     hacker said.  "I'd call Sears and have a dozen toilets shipped  to
     his house."

  .  Meanwhile, back on Dragonfire, my teletrial was going strong.
     The charges,  as pressed my Unknown Warrior,  include "endangering
     all phreaks and hacks." The judge in this case is  a  hacker  with
     the  apt name of Ax Murderer.  Possible sentences range from exile
     from the entire planet" to "kill the dude." King Blotto has  taken
     up my defense,  using hacker power to make his first pleading:  he
     dialed  up  Dragonfire,   broke  into  its  operating  system  and
     "crashed"  the  bulletin  board,  destroying  all  of its messages
     naming me. The board is back up now, with a retrial in full swing.
     But then,  exile from the electronic underground looks better  all
     the time.
