salt
Add to the butter/egg/sugar mix some of the flour, about 1/2
cup, then stir it all in.  A wooden spoon works wonderfully
Then add about 1/3 of the bananas, then stir them in.

nuts.
Bake at 350 F. for 20/30 mins, use the knife test to see if
finished.


Comments:
1 c bananas mooshed equals about 2 mediums, 1 1/2 large.
(freeze them for about 2 days to get the degree of black
awful nastiness you want)
PS, don't melt the butter/marj, instead have it all room
temp.  Works best.
