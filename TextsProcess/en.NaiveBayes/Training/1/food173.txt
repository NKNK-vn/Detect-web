Lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup; level off.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking powder,
baking soda, and salt.

In another bowl, beat with a fork, the egg, oil, and vanilla extract until well
blended.  Add to the flour mixture.  Add the Coca-Cola, prunes, and nuts; blend
thoroughly with a spoon.  Turn into a well-greased, lightly floured, 9x5x3-inch
loaf pan.  Garnish with prune halves, if desired.

Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 1 hour or until a wooden
toothpick inserted in the center comes out cleans.  Cool on a rack for 20
minutes before removing the bread from the pan.  Store in foil overnight before
slicing.  Makes 1 loaf.
